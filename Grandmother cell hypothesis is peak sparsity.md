The grandmother cell hypothesis argues that there are cortical neurons which selectively code single specific concepts, such as one's grandmother. Those gnostic neurons seem to code abstract concepts all by themselves, and respond robustly to variations of that same concept. The grandmother cell hypothesis is a perspective of extreme sparsity, compared to views of more interconnected and distributed representations.
