Lamme's model of consciousness and attention suggests that sensory information first enters consciousness and only then enters awareness. In Lamme's view, sensory information which only makes it into consciousness spawns fleeting and transient representations which can be solidified through attention. Lamme argues that the role of attention is to select transient representations formed in consciousness for making them more solid and robust, possibly transferring them to working memory afterwards. On a neuroscientific level, Lamme argues that quirks of the brain, engrained through both nature and nurture, manage to nudge sensory processing into favoring certain contents. The feed-forward sweep (FFS) of information through brain pathways doesn't appear to correlate with awareness, yet the later recurrent processing (RP) does. Through competition, sensory information with the highest relevance to current plans, goals, or actions is eventually selected in executive or mnemonic areas.
