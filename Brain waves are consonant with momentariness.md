Neuroscience sheds light on rhythms of neural activity and information processing in the brain. These findings are closely related to the timing of various events in the recurring cascade of sensation, perception, attention, and awareness. The rhythms of neural activity appear compatible with the meditative insights into the momentariness of experience, and may provide a neuroscientific basis for it. The momentariness of experience is related to the seemingly fleeting and transient clouds of sensations which form our conscious life.
