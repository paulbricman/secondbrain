Genetics can be seen as an evolution of evolution, in that it's a mechanism for persisting "solutions" to difficult evolutionary "problems" across generations so that new generations don't have to constantly reinvent the wheel of thriving in an ecology. However, junk DNA has been observed to also carry meaningless information, challenging this hard adaptationist take. Kurzweil likens the scientific body of knowledge as a genome of technology, supporting incremental development from generation to generation.
