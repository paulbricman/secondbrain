In the motor "homonculus", the size of the regions associated with various body parts is not proportional to the physical size of those body parts. Instead, the motor cortex seems to perform cognitive magnification for function, instead of structure. However, [[Perception and motor action distort spatial representation|this]] might be [[If physical space informs conceptual space, how does it fit in three dimensions?|useful]]. This premotor orientation supports the action-oriented enactive view of cognition.
