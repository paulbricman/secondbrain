Cartesian anxiety refers to the incessant human craving for an absolute ground, an absolute reference point with respect to which they can predictably operate. This search for an objective "outside" world is reflected in the ideal of mind as a mirror of nature. Through cognitive dissonance, Cartesian anxiety discourages one from considering any belief structure which is at odds with objectivism and the sense of the world as an absolute ground.
