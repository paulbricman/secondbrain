If a patient internalizes a set of beliefs during memetic psychotherapy and then her actions are influenced by it, then is she completely responsible for her actions? Or is the therapist responsible for her actions? Or is the computational component involved in computer-aided rationalization? Additionally memetic psychotherapy may provide a painkiller for cognitive dissonance. Will this cause addiction? In this sense, memetic psychotherapy is morally ambiguous, yet insights from contemporary therapy might resolve this ambiguity.
