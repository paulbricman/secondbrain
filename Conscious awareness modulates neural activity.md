The 2AFC paradigm (two-alternative forced choice) is very effective in psychology. By manipulating the signal-to-noise ratio in a 2AFC experiment, researchers noticed that psychometric curves are not linear. NCC (neural correlates of consciousness) are brain regions which appear to modulate consciousness. In a 2AFC, neural activity is influenced by whether you notice the signal, not only based on the presence of the signal. The locations of NCC's make it seem that consciousness and attention share brain regions. Due to the high correlation between attended stimuli and consciously reported stimuli, some think that consciousness and attention are the same function. Through contextual modelation, it has been observed that early receptive fields which don't cover the stimulus are actually later influenced in terms of activity by context. Contextual modulation appears non-existing without awareness, when monkeys didn't notice the stimuli. There seem to be opposite results, contextual modulation studies report NCC's in V1, while 2AFC studies report NCC's in the frontoparietal network. All contemporary models postulate that consciousness is the result of complex brain activity. Interactions between different brain areas are believed to be essential.
