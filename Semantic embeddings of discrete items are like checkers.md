Discrete items, such as words, being embedded in a semantic space can be seen as individual checker pieces. The relative arrangement of those items is particularly important, and it's reflected in the configuration of the checker board containing the individual pieces. This embedding-checkers metaphor provides a tangible way of reasoning about how the meaning of items in a latent space is derived mainly through their relative arrangement.
