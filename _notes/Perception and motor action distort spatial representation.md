Cognitive magnification takes place across all modalities. The somatosensory "homonculus" is highly distorted, leading to [[Manifolds formalize emergence|a non-linear representation of the body]]. The retinotopic organization of the early visual cortex regions distorts the representation of the visual field. This is also reflected in the systematically distorted drawings of childredn around the world. However, the conscious awareness of this distortion is limited. Still, this non-linearity can be an innate mechanism enabling intricate non-linear manifold structures to be derived in neural space.
