[[MCMC is feasibe compared to IID sampling|MCMC samplers]] are based on informed walks in the population space. The Metropolis sampler is a specific [[MCMC is feasibe compared to IID sampling|MCMC sampler]] based on effective heuristics. At each sampled point, a (local) [[Boltzmann distribution links macrostates with microstate probabilities|proposal distribution]] is used to sample the next one. The candidate point is accepted with an acceptance probability determined by the PDF values of the two.
