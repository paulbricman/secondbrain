Apply defaults in a row, and you get a sequence. When you apply defaults, the in-sets refer to what beliefs you're taking as true in the process. The out-sets refer to what beliefs you can't now be taking as true, given some assumptions you've made. In default logic, processes refer to sequences which are coherent in terms of their in-sets and out-sets.
