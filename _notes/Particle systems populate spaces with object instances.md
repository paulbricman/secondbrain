In 3D modeling, particle systems repeatedly instantiate an object and treat each instance in a slightly different way. The particles being generated belong to the same family, yet are uniquely modified across a small subset of attribute dimensions. [[Selectively sampling dimensions facilitates manifold definition|Those variable attributes alone can describe the particle system]].
