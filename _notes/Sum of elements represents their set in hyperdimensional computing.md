In [[Curse of dimensionality hinders high-dimensional mappings|large vector spaces]], summing multiple vectors denoting concepts (i.e. [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|mixing them]]) can stand for a set containing them. That is because the sum is commutative, just like the set notation. Additionally, the set sum eventually shares features with individual set members across various dimensions.
