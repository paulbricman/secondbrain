As [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|supervised learning is used to approximate an underlying mapping]] across spaces with [[Multi-modal encoders enable cross-modal guidance in latent space|higher and higher dimensionality]], the [[Supervised learning is argmin in hypothesis space of model architecture|model]] becomes more and more prone to [[Machine learning models have fluid and crystallized intelligence|overfitting]]. Specific tricks like [[Regularization penalizes flexibility|regularization and adapting model flexibility]] are used to tackle this Lovecraftian issue.
