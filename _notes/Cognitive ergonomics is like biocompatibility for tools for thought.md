Mechanical [[Phenomenological transparency underpins affordances|prosthetics]] have to be manufactured from biocompatible materials, so that the adjacent [[Body seeks homeostasis|human tissue]] plays along well and doesn't [[Stress-induced disease is a metabolic prioritization issue|attack]] it. Similarly, [[Tools for thought interface users with knowledge|tools for thought]] have to be [[Tools for thought should amplify fundamental capabilities|cognitively ergonomic]] so that the user adopts them as part of their [[Human emulations induce feeling of disposability|intimate thought process]] and doesn't reject them as clunky. Concretely, a [[Conversational interfaces render knowledge bases into agents|conversational interface]] based on [[Electromyography enables covert speech recognition|speech recognition and synthesis]] might need to emulate the user's self-perceived voice for effective adoption. As another example, [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|tools for manipulating concepts]] should make use of a [[Embeddings in machine learning represent prototypes or exemplars|semantic space]] [[Alignment is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive|aligned]] with the user's [[Rich mental model repository is conductive of insight|conceptual framework]].
