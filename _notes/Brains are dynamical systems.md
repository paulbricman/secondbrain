The brain is a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous-state continuous-time dynamical system]]. Its [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|state space]] is defined as the space of all possible [[Context disambiguates observed neural activity|neural activity]]. Its autonomous [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|transition function]] is based on [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|internal wiring]]. [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|Trajectories are thought patterns]]. The input function is [[Perception is context-dependent|perception]], and takes into account both internal and external states. The output is motor action.
