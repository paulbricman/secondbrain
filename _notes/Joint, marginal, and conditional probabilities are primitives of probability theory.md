Joint probability is the probability of two events occurring at the same time. Marginal probability is the probability of an event occurring regardless of events across other dimensions. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring in the limited bracket of another event occurring. Those provide a framework for [[KL-divergence formalizes difference between discrete probability distributions|probability]], just like [[Tense logic formalizes time|tense logic provides a framework for events unfolding in time]].
