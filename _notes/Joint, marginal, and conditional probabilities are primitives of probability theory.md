Joint probability is the probability of two [[Subscribe-notify pattern streamlines event handling|events]] occurring at the same time. Marginal probability is the probability of an [[Selective attention amplifies event-related potential|event]] occurring regardless of events across [[Particle systems populate spaces with object instances|other dimensions]]. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring in the limited bracket of another event occurring. Those provide a framework for [[KL-divergence formalizes difference between discrete probability distributions|probability]], just like [[Tense logic formalizes time|tense logic provides a framework for events unfolding in time]].
