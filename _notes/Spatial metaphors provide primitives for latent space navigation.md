In a latent space, related concepts are geometrically close to each other. What's more, [[Metaphor is central to cognition|conceptual parallels]] show up as geometrical parallels. [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region]], which supports this [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|spatial reasoning]]. Based on this [[Semantic embeddings of discrete items are like checkers|spatial metaphor of concepts]], one can use the following [[Phenomenological transparency underpins affordances|primitives]] for navigating the [[Symbols diffuse in latent space|latent space]] in a meaningful way, among others.
- **Field**: find concepts which are close to a given concept.
- **Mix**: find concepts which are close to the center of some given concepts.
- **Span**: find concepts located along the line between two given concepts.
- **Shift**: determine the directed difference in location between two given concepts.
- **Match**: find constellations of concepts which match the shape of a given constellation of concepts.
