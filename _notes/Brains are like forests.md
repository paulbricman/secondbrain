The brain-forest metaphor highlights the resilient and [[Parallel distributed processing is resilient and efficient|distributed]] nature of the [[Brains are like oceans|brain]]. Neurons are trees which form a forest. Cut down one tree, and the forest recovers. Trees form networks linked by fungi just like neurons form networks linked by synapses. Additionally, it's easy to miss the forest for the trees, and focus on individual neurons as the key to engineering [[LSTMs mitigate RNN issues|AI]], whereas the aggregate "forest" [[Neural dynamicity has evolutionary advantages|dynamics]] might be a more fertile approach.
