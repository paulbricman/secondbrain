If one subscribes to the idea of neuroplasticity being embedded in the folding dynamics of a neural manifold, then the drive for elegant and simple explanations and models can be assimilated with a drive for dimensionality reduction. In a fervent attempt to collapse dimensions, find commonalities, and increase coherence, people seek the most elegant and simple explanations, because we're wired to do so on a neuroplasticity level. However, it might also be so that we simply internalized a belief which praises simplicity, so much so that it guides our science.
