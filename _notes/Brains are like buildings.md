The brain-building metaphor highlights the distinction between brain structure and function. Brain structure corresponds to building structure. Additionally, just like a building supports social functions (e.g. work, leisure, etc.), the [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|brain supports various cognitive functions]] (e.g. hope, act, etc.). It is architecture which connects structure and function, both for the building and the brain. This idea gave rise to the notion of [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture|cognitive architectures]].
