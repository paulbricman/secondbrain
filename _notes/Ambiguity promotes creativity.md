Some argue that ambiguity promotes [[Creativity is based on search, not generation|creativity]]. In an ambiguous representation, be it [[Multi-modal encoders enable cross-modal guidance in latent space|descriptive, depictive]], or otherwise, people seem to "see" unusual things. Ambiguous stimuli might force [[Perception is context-dependent|perception]] into unusual inferences, in [[GLOM enables hierarchical representations in continuous spaces|an effort to bring coherence to the scene]]. This view seems consonant with the idea of constraints fostering creativity, because the constraints are embedded in ambiguity.
