Ambiguous representations, both [[Multi-modal encoders enable cross-modal guidance in latent space|descriptive and depictive]], yield [[Personalized language model perplexity approximates surprisal|surprising]] [[Neuroimaging is like interpretable ML|interpretations]]. In an effort to [[GLOM enables hierarchical representations in continuous spaces|generate coherence]], the [[Perception is context-dependent|perceiver]] is forced into unusual inferences. This view is consonant with constraints fostering [[Creativity is based on search, not generation|creativity]], as constraints are embedded in ambiguity.
