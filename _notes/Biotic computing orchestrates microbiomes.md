Just like [[First-person projection is intuitive in programming|digital programming]] consists of orchestrating electrons, biotic programming consists of orchestrating microorganisms (e.g. euglena, paramecium) inside a biotic processing unit. By controlling the physical environment (e.g. light, temperature, etc.), a biotic programmer guides behavior in computationally useful ways. Biotic server farms make this accessible, enabling [[Elderly scaffold neural circuits to compensate for cognitive decline|elastic scaling]].
