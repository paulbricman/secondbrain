Imagine a [[Semantic hash tables enable fuzzy key-value storage|semantic hash table]] which contains sentence embeddings as keys and contact details as values. The embedded sentences can be questions [[Validation through creation quantifies free learning|free learners]] are thinking about and are trying to answer. By [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|finding close inquiries in semantic space]], this system could connect free learners whose learning objectives are [[Alignment is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive|aligned]]. Such a system might be part of the puzzle of building infrastructure for [[Creative output can support educational input in free learning|free learning]], specifically tackling Ivan Illich's point of peer match-making.
