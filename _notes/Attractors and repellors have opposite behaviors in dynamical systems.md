In a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical systems]], attractors are states surrounded by [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|basins]] which nudge all [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|trajectories]] towards them. In contrast, repellors are states surrounded by regions which divert all trajectories away. Generally, attractors are stable, while repellors are not.
