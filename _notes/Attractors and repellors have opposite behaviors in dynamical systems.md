In a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical systems]], attractors are states surrounded by a [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|basin]] which nudges all [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|trajectories]] towards them. In contrast, repellors are states surrounded by a basin which diverts all trajectories away from them. Generally, attractors are stable, while repellors are not.
