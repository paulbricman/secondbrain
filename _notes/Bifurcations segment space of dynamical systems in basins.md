In a [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical system]], bifurcations are critical values of [[Argmin and argmax formalize optimization|control parameters]]. Those values are located just between two different basins of [[Attractors and repellors have opposite behaviors in dynamical systems|attraction]] of [[Structural stability describes basin of similar dynamical systems|structurally stable]] [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|dynamical systems]].
