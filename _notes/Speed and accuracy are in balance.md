In experimental psychology, guidelines for focusing on responding quickly usually result in lower accuracy. Conversely, guidelines for focusing on high accuracy usually result in increased response times. There is a [[Experience sampling faces an accuracy-attrition trade-off|trade-off]] between speed and accuracy when [[Rotating interventions accelerate behavior change|working with behavior]]. In light of this, mechanisms which automatically increase accuracy (e.g. [[Shape autocorrect facilitates diagram creation through gesturing|autocorrect]]) allow the user to be sloppier, and therefore faster.
