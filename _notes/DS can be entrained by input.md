A [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical system]] can get entrained by its input, meaning that it's strongly determined by it and oscillates with a similar period. However, this only happens when the [[Cluster index quantifies internal-external connectivity|internal connectivity is low and the external connectivity is high]]. Additionally, it typically manifests after a [[Fleeting note persisting resembles memory consolidation|transient period]].
