In game theory, Pareto improvements are any changes in [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|state]] which result in a [[Extrinsic reward dependence is unsustainable|better situation]] for some [[Conversational interfaces render knowledge bases into agents|agents]], similar situations for others, and worse situations for none. When no Pareto improvements are available in a state, that state is Pareto optimal.
