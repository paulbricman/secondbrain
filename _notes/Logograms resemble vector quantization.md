They are self-contained discrete tokens which can take on many meanings, and are composable in surprising ways. In this, logograms resemble vector quantization in machine learning, in that they're [[Emergent properties are dependent on low-level state|self-contained, rich in information]], and [[Context-independent strategies are like good chess moves|composable based on context]].
