Saccades often exhibit curvature. Consonant with the premotor theory of attention, modulating covert premotor attention influences the subsequent saccade trajectory. This saccade curvature can be induced through distractors. This finding is compatible with the model of attention itself as being based on a salience map. Eye movement would seek to navigate towards a salience optimum, while being nudged along the way.
