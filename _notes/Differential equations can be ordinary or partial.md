Differential equations describe how [[Training and inference maintain and change different values|changes in some functions result in changes in some other functions]], recursively. When only considering [[Intricate functions whose inverse is trivial are easy to approximate|functions of one variable]] (usually time), they're called ordinary differential equations. When considering functions of multiple variables, and therefore using partial derivatives rather than derivatives, they're called partial differential equations.
