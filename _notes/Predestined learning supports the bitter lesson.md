The Bitter Lesson argues that, based on empirical observations of the field, machine learning should focus on developing [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|meta-level learning strategies]], based on which the model would derive the rest, compared to engineering [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|symbolic domain-specific knowledge]] into the system. In a similar manner, Minsky argues that that's also all that we have, a mechanism for [[Similar embodiment predicts manifold alignment|predestined learning]], which drives us into developing similar [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|conceptual frameworks]].
