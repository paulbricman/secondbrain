In a Feynman cluster, free learners from widely different disciplines can come together and teach each other about key insights, nuggets, and findings they encountered recently. Due to the widely different backgrounds involved in a Feynman cluster, teaching is similar to practicing the Feynman technique, but in a more social context. The Feynman cluster gives rise positive-sum situation between learners and teachers, because they both have something to gain: new knowledge and better understanding, respectively. Besides enabling the positive-sum loop, social structure can also make the Feynman technique more enjoyable and accountable.
