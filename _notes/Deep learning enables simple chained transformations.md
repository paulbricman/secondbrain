Compared to [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|arbitrarily wide perceptrons]] which describe a one-step transformation, [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|deep learning]] often describes [[Can cognitive tasks be factored?|a series of simpler chained transformations]]. This [[Backpropagation through time makes RNNs feasible|makes deep learning practical]], even if [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|one-layer]] [[Perceptron pioneers NN's|perceptrons]] could always do the job in theory.
