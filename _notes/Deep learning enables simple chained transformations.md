Compared to [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|arbitrarily wide perceptrons]] which describe a single transformation, [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|deep learning]] often describes a series of simpler transformations which can are chained together. This makes deep learning practical, even if [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|one-layer perceptrons could always do the job in theory]].
