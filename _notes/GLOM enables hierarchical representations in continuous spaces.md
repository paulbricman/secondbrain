By representing a [[Tokenization for i+1 language learning is non-trivial|token]] at multiple levels of abstraction concurrently, [[Attention is representational resource allocation|from the fine structure to the coarse one, one can derive hierarchical representations]]. Elements which have [[Sum of elements represents their set in hyperdimensional computing|a lot in common]] at coarse levels might be on the same branch, only to break off at a finer level. This approach might enable consequential explanations in [[Perception is context-dependent|perception]], [[Memory is perception of structural artifacts|memory]], and [[Discrete structure embeddings in continuous space are glitchy|intelligence]], if combined with other mechanisms such as [[Memory can be content-based or location-based|content-based memory addressing]]. GLOM might also be useful in a [[Multi-modal mappings generate multi-modal receptive fields|multi-modal setting]], by housing [[Multi-modal representations foster understanding|multi-modal percepts]] of an object at levels below its representation.
