The huge diversity of logics, including [[Modal logic proper enables possible worlds semantics|modal logic]], [[Default logic processes formalize sequential reasoning|default logic]], or [[Tense logic formalizes time|tense logic]], provide formal conceptual frameworks for describing, evaluating, and managing truth. Through domain-specific operators such as [[Tense logic formalizes time|time-related ones]], logics provide tools for reasoning about truth in certain complex situations.
