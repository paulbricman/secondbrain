Many research efforts go into coming up with frameworks for splitting [[Cognitive augmentation is morally unambiguous when rehabilitative|cognitive tasks]] into more [[Language models are few-shot learners|manageable atomic pieces]]. But can cognitive tasks be factored this way? Tasks where the [[Creative output can support educational input in free learning|inputs and outputs]] are discrete and easy to interpret might be composed with others. However, tasks where the inputs and outputs are [[Embeddings in machine learning represent prototypes informed by exemplars|abstract representations]] containing [[Computer vision enables visual mnemonic mining|rich information]] might not be.
