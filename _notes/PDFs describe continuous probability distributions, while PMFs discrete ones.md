[[Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities are primitives of probability theory|Probability]] density functions (PDFs) link [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous]] [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|states]] [[Boltzmann distribution links macrostates with microstate probabilities|with probabilities]]. However, deriving probabilies using PDFs only works for intervals. In contrast, [[Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities are primitives of probability theory|probability]] mass functions (PMFs) map [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|finite state sets]] to probabilities which are meaningful for both single states and subsets.
