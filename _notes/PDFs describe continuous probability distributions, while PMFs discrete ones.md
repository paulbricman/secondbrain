[[Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities are primitives of probability theory|Probability]] density functions (PDFs) link [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous]] [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|states]] [[Boltzmann distribution links macrostates with microstate probabilities|with probabilities]]. However, evaluating a PDF at a single state is meaningless, as it's only relevant over intervals. In contrast, [[Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities are primitives of probability theory|probability]] mass functions (PMFs) map [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|finite state sets]] to probabilities which are also meaningful for a single state.
