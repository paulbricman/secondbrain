unconvential computing bring the promise of energy efficiency from the brain
neural networks are a massive conceptual gateway (theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, theoretical physics, cognitive science...)
assumption of output based on function + noise, good model, loss
one-hot encodings are basis vectors in type space
risk is statistical expectation of loss, actual target of ML, approximated by empirical risk
argmin and argmax formalize optimization
model-based ML is argmin in the space defined by architecture
