multi-lingual embeddings makes geography of thought accessible
load influences distractor processing
core items are centroids in latent space
constructivism fosters scaffolding, leverages context

egocentric projection to agent is intuitive in programming, VR makes that easy!
different exemplars contraint forces one to softly move out of comfort zone of prototype
programming metaphors become explicit, embodied in VR (libary, loop, function calling, objects, if branching)
AR renders concepts into tangible objects
sketchnotes hint at latent visual capability, AR/VR can actualize it
VR further extends sketchpad

design thinking extends design conception beyond graphics
digital twin

Optimal knowledge transfer, what would that be among note systems?
Optimal glimpse into one's knowledge, what would that be?

Cultural alignment, shared experience, means.. neural manifold alignment, just with physical space!
Mixing in latent space of neural manifolds enable first person view sharing
Sensory recruitment hypothesis predicts reduced wm capacity in sensory deprivation? Yeah not really actually
UPDATE nn's combine mem and compute, just like the real deal, with memories
P-zombie for past self
Value of otherness transcends first person view sharing curiosity

second brain is characterized by pragmatic inertia around start time
