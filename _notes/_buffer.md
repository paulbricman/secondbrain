fluid circuits
biotic games (electric fields), biotic programming, micro robotic swarm, biotic server farms
braitenberg vehicles (euglena, paramecia are love I think?)

Morphemes provide explocit position cues, word pieces, peri
Body equilibrium is homeostasis, vs stressor
Acute vs chronic stress, exapted unintentionally
Stress-induced disease is metabolic prioritization issue
Stress in continuum, boring awesome horrible
Stress weakens PFC hold on limbic, like testosterone (via glucocorticoids?)
Stress is peak exploitation in cognitive behavioral metabolic foraging
Catharsis blunts stress response
Stress modulates us/them definition
From causes to enabling constraints

Binding concepts for computing position?
Concept handles are like addresses in conceptual space

Update memory as artifact based on inscription hypothesis

Tools as body, equal footing, phenomenological transparency
Quantified self, neuroimaging as physical introspection in function
Memory is like a manuscript
Neural activity is like airflow, pressure and vector field
Location on neural manifold during emulation crucial

Semantic clustering of book paragraphs for necronimicon
