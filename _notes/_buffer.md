Allocentric perspective avoids biases? Link to egocentric perspective
Autonomy, reduction, and the various configurations in philosophy of science (esp for the mind)

Transdisciplinary breakthroughs not because obscure new perspectives, but because more perspectives are essential

Stable orbits in the space of lies, Egan
Leverage intermediate beliefs as attractor in kinetics
Ideological debt as gravitational force in some memetic space
Egan's meltdown is memetic 9/11
Meltdown diffuses spatial bounds on memes, but this is the same as the global information society point! Amazing!
Recommendation systems can support constructivism
Memetic protectionism enables ideological momentum, avoiding attractors, but as wanderer, is a meme
Planning trajectory in memetic space, the mere idea
Perihelion and aphelion formalize optimization based on orbits?
Abstract dimensions projected on space (consciousness, time, ideology)
