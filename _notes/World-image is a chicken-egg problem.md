The debate between [[Cognitive realism versus idealism|realism and idealism]] in the context of [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|representations]] can seen as a chicken-egg problem. Who came first, the world or the image? Realism argues that the world informs representations, while idealism argues that representations inform our world. [[Darwinism infuses enaction with realism|Enaction]] attempts to solve the world-image problem by arguing that the two are mutually-informing. Enaction argues that cognition is an emergent property of a tight sensorimotor loop which links [[Perception is context-dependent|perception]] with action. At the extreme, enaction suggests that perception is as much guided by action as premotor intentions as is action guided by perception. [[Phenomenological transparency underpins affordances|Naive realism is to be expected]].
