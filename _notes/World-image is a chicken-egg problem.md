The debate between realism and idealism in the context of representations can seen as a chicken-egg problem. Who came first, the world or the image? Realism argues that the world informs representations, while idealism argues that representations inform our world. Enaction attempts to solve the world-image problem by arguing that the two are mutually-informing. Enaction argues that cognition is an emergent property of a tight sensorimotor loop which links perception with action. At the extreme, enaction suggests that perception is as much guided by action as premotor intentions as is action guided by perception.
