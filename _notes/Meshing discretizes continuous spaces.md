When dealing with [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous spaces]], it's often useful to discretize them to be able to use the advanced mathematical machinery available for discrete systems. This can be done with meshing, a family of techniques for performing this [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|mapping]]. However, [[Discrete structure embeddings in continuous space are glitchy|discrete-continuous transformations are glitchy]] and inevitably result in error.
