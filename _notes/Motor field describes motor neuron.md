Just as [[Multi-modal mappings generate multimodal receptive fields|a neuron involved in vision fires selectively in response to a certain kind of feature in a certain part of the visual field]], a neuron involved in motor action also fires selectively when carrying out a certain movement towards a specific direction. A neuron involved in motor action can be said to have a motor field, just as a neuron involved in visual perception can be said to have a receptive field.
