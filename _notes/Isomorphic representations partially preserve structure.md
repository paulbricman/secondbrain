[[Logograms resemble vector quantization|Discrete symbols often represent entities without any notion of preserved structure]]. In contrast, many families of [[Semantic embeddings of discrete items are like checkers|semantic embeddings]] do [[Embeddings in machine learning represent prototypes or exemplars|conserve structure]] through [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|relative configuration]]. [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|Representations]] which conserve structure at least partially can be called isomorphic.
