If you use the many small decisions made by a crowd to inform a search process through a latent space, you can approximate convex optimization. Optimizer-specific dynamics such as [[Momentum in optimization is trend observation in retrospective futurism|momentum]] can also be integrated to determine [[Continuous user signal provides rich feedback for navigating latent spaces|user prompts]] for optimal convergence. In the case of a creative task, this is consonant with the view of [[Creativity is based on search, not generation|creativity as search]]. That said, [[Human API pushes crowdsourcing on the tech stack|crowdsourcing]] might also be useful for [[Optimization is not open-ended|open-ended tasks]].
