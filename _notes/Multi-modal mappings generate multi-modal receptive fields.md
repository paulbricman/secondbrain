Both [[Neural networks are a massive conceptual gateway|artificial and biological neurons]] appear to develop receptive fields which [[Multi-modal representations foster understanding|span multiple modalities]] if initially exposed to multi-modal data. In such contexts, it doesn't seem like neurons specialize in responding to individual modalities, likely due to the mutually-informing dimensions of the data itself. This further suggests that cognitive processes are not conducted in isolation, but in a deep interconnected fashion from which an abstract conceptual understanding emerges.
