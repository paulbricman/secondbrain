Words like "stress", "joy", or "tired" evoke specific [[Triune brain model classifies brain regions through evolutionary lens|limbic]] states [[Context-independent strategies are like good chess moves|in relation to other]] [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|concepts]]. This hints at the fact that speakers of a certain language think in slightly different, although internally consistent, ways.
