Acquiring tacit knowledge effectively can be seen as the challenge of getting from [[Skill acquisition spans cognitive-associative-autonomous stages|cognitive to autonomous]] as fast as possible. In deliberate practice, this transition is facilitated by accelerating instance-based learning [[Skill acquisition spans cognitive-associative-autonomous stages|from the cognitive to the associative phase]]. In contrast, learning from expert feedback facilitates tacit knowledge acquisition by accelerating production compilation and utility learning, to use [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture|ACT-R formalism]]. Expert feedback provides a rich signal which captures the expert's [[Commonsense is a causal model repository|intuition]], rather than the specifics of the task. Turning expert intuition into the object of learning, rather than the skill itself, appears useful for effectively acquiring tacit knowledge. This is elegantly supported by [[Tacit knowledge in skill acquisition is dark knowledge in machine learning|dark knowledge]].
