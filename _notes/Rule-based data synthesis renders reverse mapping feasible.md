Computing [[Brains are like stadiums|EEG data]] corresponding to a certain dipole configuration enables [[Brains are like stadiums|the mapping of EEG data to individual dipoles]] with [[Machine learning ignores progressive nature of human learning|machine learning]]. Computing the sum of pseudorandom signals enables the decomposition of other signals to pseudorandom seeds. This joins [[Predictive world models turn compute into data|forecasting]], [[Recovery and matching provide self-supervised signals|recovery, and mapping]] in mechanisms for generating data from scratch.
