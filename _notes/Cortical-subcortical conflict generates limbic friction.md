Even though this notion unquestioningly subscribes to the anatomical dichotomy of cortical/subcortical being superimposed on cognitive function, it successfully highlights the demanding conflict between goals at those different levels. Moreover, it seems like [[Extrinsic reward dependence is unsustainable|systematically rewarding top-down effort helps develop endurance to limbic friction]].
