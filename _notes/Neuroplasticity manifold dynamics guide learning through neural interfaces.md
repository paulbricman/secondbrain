Assuming that [[Neuroplasticity is like protein folding|neuroplasticity is based on idiosyncratic dynamics]] [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|modulated by metabolism]], one might wonder how this could inform [[Brain-in-edit-mode supports inquiry in applied cognitive neuroscience|learning through neural interfaces]]. Could [[Forecasting forces predictive world models to internalize meaningful representations|models forecast]] meaningful changes in knowledge based on [[Neuroplasticity is like protein folding|neuroplasticity mechanics]]?
