Continuous-state [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|dynamical systems]] are as diverse as [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|finite-state ones]]. They can either use [[Tense logic formalizes time|discrete]] or continuous [[Time is a relevant dimension of attention|time]], and [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|share the same basic anatomy]], although using [[Embeddings in machine learning represent prototypes or exemplars|continuous states]]. For the ones with continuous time, the transition function yields [[Differential equations can be ordinary or partial|rates of change]], rather than absolute values. They all exhibit typical behaviors: [[Attractors and repellors have opposite behaviors in dynamical systems|attractors and repellors]], [[Bifurcations segment space of dynamical systems in basins|bifurcation]], and chaos.
