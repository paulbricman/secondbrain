Just like [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|finite-state dynamical systems are diverse]], so are continuous-state ones. They can have either [[Tense logic formalizes time|discrete]] or continuous [[Time is a relevant dimension of attention|time]], and [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|share the same basic anatomy]], although with continuous states. For the ones with continuous time, the transition function yields a rate of change, rather than new values. They all exhibit typical behaviors: [[Attractors and repellors have opposite behaviors in dynamical systems|attractors and repellors]], [[Bifurcations slice space of dynamical systems in basins|bifurcation]].
