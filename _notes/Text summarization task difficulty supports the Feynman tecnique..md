It turns out that in machine learning, the task of abstractive summarization (i.e. writing a summary of a piece of content in your own words) is much more computationally involved than extractive summarization (i.e. extracting the central parts of a piece of content). This fact highlights the (beneficial) elaborative load of [[Summarization forces understanding|abstractive summarization]]. This supports the value of the [[Feynman cluster infuses learning by teaching with social structure|Feynman technique]].
