Contrastive learning is essentially machine learning based on strategically sampling counterexamples for a given concept. Similarly, some sociologists argue that criminality and deviant behavior is essential for a well-functioning society because it provides "counterexamples" to the norm. Essentially, deviants successfully inform the social norm space, perhaps better than actual explicit norms. Their expressiveness is essential, as without them society would lose a sense of definition, there would be a collapse, like in machine learning.
