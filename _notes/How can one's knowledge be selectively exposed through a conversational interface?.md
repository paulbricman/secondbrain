If one is wrapping a [[Conversational interfaces render knowledge bases into agents|conversational interface around their knowledge base]], but they also store highly sensitive information in there, then how can they selectively share the non-sensitive [[Creative output can support educational input in free learning|creative output]]? A low-tech approach would be to use keywords for restricting outputs. Additionally, semantic distance to such keywords could be used as an indicator of sensitivity. However, [[Natural language inference derives conceptual structure|natural language inference]] can be used to evaluate whether a given response contains sensitive information, similar to descriptive search.
