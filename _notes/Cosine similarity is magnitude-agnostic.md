While the L1, L2 norms, and p-norm in general are [[Optimizing for short semantic distances fosters learning|distance functions]] which take into consideration the magnitude of the two [[One-hot encodings are basis vectors in type space|vectors]] involved, the cosine similarity only indicates how strong are they [[Alignment is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive|aligned]], regardless of their magnitude. Cosine similarity is the default choice in [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|comparing]] [[Multi-lingual embeddings formalize geography of thought|word embeddings]].
