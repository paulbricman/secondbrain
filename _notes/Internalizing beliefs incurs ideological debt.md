Assuming one's ideological mark-up can be viewed as [[Memetic probing can be conducted through a wide range of techniques|a finite collection of interconnected beliefs]], it is possible to make a parallel between the internalization of beliefs and the idea of debt. When internalizing a belief, one is "buying into it" based on [[Cognitive dissonance reduction drive influences body state|coherence]] with [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|prior beliefs]]. However, by "buying into" a plethora of mutually-compatible beliefs in a craving for [[Neural manifold folding explains explanatory drive|explanatory power]], one is essentially getting into debt. The ideological debt parallel highlights the fact that a mutually-reinforced belief structure is especially rigid and inflexible to perturbations. Accumulating ideological debt hurdles the explorative dimension of memetic foraging. This mindset narrowing resembles [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|rigidity induced by arousal]].
