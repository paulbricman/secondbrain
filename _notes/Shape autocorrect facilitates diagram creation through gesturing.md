It's difficult for someone to draw a perfect circle without assistance. However, [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|movement supports reasoning]] and [[Drawing surfaces extend visuospatial sketchpad|drawing surfaces extend working memory]], so it would be useful to reduce this friction. In light of this, heuristics or [[Data-driven modeling renders physical simulation feasible|data-driven modeling]] could be used to detect strokes which resemble predefined shapes (e.g. circle, square, car), and autocorrect them.
