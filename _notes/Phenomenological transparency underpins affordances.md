Phenomenological transparency refers to the experience of a tool being part of your body. Drivers extend their [[Conscious awareness modulates neural activity|situational awareness]] to that of their car. Phenomeneological transparency and the mechanisms which presumably support it might be the foundation of affordances. However, it seems to be [[Motor cortex magnifies by function, not structure|proportional to the fluency of using tools]]. With a strong [[Premotor theory of attention is fundamentally enactive|enactive and premotor attitude]], one could envision a phenomenological theory of affordances which might integrate with James Gibson's model. The phenomenology of [[Tools for thought interface users with knowledge|tools for thought and their affordances]] provides a particularly intriguing line of inquiry. Interestingly enough, this suggests that tools get [[Cognitive augmentation is morally unambiguous when rehabilitative|on equal footing]] with [[Neural emulation simply provides bodily redundancy|other parts of the body]].
