If the [[Risk is statistical expectation of loss|risk function]] is differentiable (i.e. NOT only the model itself), as it is often the case in [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|machine learning]], then [[Momentum in optimization is trend observation in retrospective futurism|optimization]] can be performed by gradient descent. Essentially, the model parameters are tweaked so that the [[Risk is statistical expectation of loss|risk]] gets minimized.
