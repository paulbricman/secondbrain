The two conflicting movements which characterize the pupil are guided by different nervous systems. Pupil dilation is associated with high arousal, and is directed by the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast, pupil constriction is associated with low arousal, and is directed by the parasympathetic nervous system. Those movements, and likely the larger networks which contain them, are antagonistic.
