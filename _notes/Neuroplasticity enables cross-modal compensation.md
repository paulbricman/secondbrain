Blind people can learn to perceive the visual world through a tactile sense, using a haptic feedback lattice. Many blind-from-birth people also report awareness of intricate spatial sturcture, derived presumably from sound and entire-body movement. Neurons with multimodal receptive fields might play an important role in this adaptation, presumably being exapted for cross-modal processing.
