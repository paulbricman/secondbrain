Blind people can learn to [[Perception is context-dependent|perceive the visual world through a tactile sense]], using a haptic feedback lattice, with [[Neuroplasticity is like protein folding|increased activation]] in the visual cortex. Many blind-from-birth people also report awareness of intricate [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region|spatial structure]], derived presumably from sound and [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|entire-body movement]]. Deaf people exhibit high activity in speech regions when interacting using sign language. [[Multi-modal mappings generate multi-modal receptive fields|Neurons with multimodal receptive fields]] might play an important role in this [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|adaptation]], presumably being exapted for cross-modal processing.
