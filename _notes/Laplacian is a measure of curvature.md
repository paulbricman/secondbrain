The Laplacian operator is a measure of "curvature" for regions of [[Risk is statistical expectation of loss|mathematical landscapes]]. It's formally defined based on the divergence of gradients in a certain region. Local optima in [[Backpropagation renders gradient descent feasible|gradient descent]] exhibit particular Laplacian properties.
