Wikipedia's policy is that the minimum requirement for inclusion of [[Creative output can support educational input in free learning|content]] is that it can be verified through a third-party resource, rather than having to clearly be true. This makes it more accessible for [[Version control systems empower creatives|users to contribute]]. SImilarly, if a [[Conversational interfaces render knowledge bases into agents|virtual assistant]] also had [[Few-shot regime enables extreme customization|generative capabilities]], then verifiability as a content policy might set useful expectations.
