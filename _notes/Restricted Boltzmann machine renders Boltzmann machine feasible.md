By restricting a [[Boltzmann machine is a universal learning machine|Boltzmann machine]] to a low number of visibles and no hiddens, training them becomes tractable. Crucially, if [[Deep learning enables simple chained transformations|chaining]] multiple such machines through overlapping [[Cluster index quantifies internal-external connectivity|neuron clusters]], one obtains a [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|neural network]] resembling [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|deep ones]].
