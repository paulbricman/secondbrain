[[Metabolism influences neural dynamics]]. During sleep, the body operates on an arguably different metabolism compared to waking, exhibiting typical brain states. Therefore, neural dynamics are different during sleep. Dreaming may be an evolutionary response to this [[Agitation can be weaponized|opportunity of harnessing otherwise unavailable neural dynamics]] in problem solving and decision making. What's more, dream recall difficulty can be explained by [[Similar embodiment predicts manifold alignment|neural manifold misalignment]] between sleep and waking brain states, similar to how [[How can routine cell replacement permit psychological continuity?|remembering old memories is difficult]]. Wake-back-to-bed technique reduces metabolic contrast and fosters recall. Therefore, dream recall should be done early in the morning, while [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|metabolic changes are still underway]]. Additionally, [[How can routine cell replacement permit psychological continuity?|continuous cross-referencing]] between representations should enable [[Conceptual gateways are like wormholes|successful transfer to waking]].
