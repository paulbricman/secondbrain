Cognitive magnification refers to [[Abundance signals fitness|larger brain regions]] being devoted to [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|processing]] [[Core items are centroids in latent space|important aspects]] of [[Eye movement stabilizes stimuli on retina|stimuli]]. However, this magnification can also be [[Tense logic formalizes time|temporal]]. By varying [[Attention distorts time|sampling rates]], [[Dynamic attention enables object permanence|dynamic attention]] induces [[Phenomenal representations are constrained mental representations|subjective time distortions]] as more information is being processed per unit time. This resembles [[Perception and motor action distort spatial representation|motor action distorting spatial perception]]. Attention-induced time distortions are also similar to overclocking a CPU.
