Traditionally, cognitive magnification refers to [[Abundance signals fitness|more brain tissue being allocated]] to the [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|processing]] of important aspects of stimuli. However, this magnification can also take place across [[Tense logic formalizes time|time]]. Through a change in the attentional "sampling rate", [[Dynamic attention enables object permanence|dynamic attention]] can induce distortions of [[Phenomenal representations are constrained mental representations|subjective time]] as more information is being processed, similar to how [[Perception and motor action distort spatial representation|motor action distorts space perception]]. Attention-induced time distortions are conceptually similar to periods of overclocking on a CPU.
