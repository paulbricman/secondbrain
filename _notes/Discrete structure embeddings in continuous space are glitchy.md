Not only is most of machine learning [[Machine learning is interpolative|interpolative]] and therefore limited in generalization, but it is often not well suited for manipulating [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|discrete structures]]. Just like a Fourier series approximates a square signal with glitches caused (i.e. Gibbs phenomenon), [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|neural networks]] are brittle when [[Mental representations connect internal with external state|representing]] discrete discontinuous structures. However, one could argue that the [[Manifolds formalize emergence|brain]] supports a [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|continuous mental and phenomenal space]], which sometimes approximates discrete systems.
