[[Neuroplasticity is like protein folding|Neuroplasticity]] decreases with age, making children the most [[Biological reward systems are malleable|malleable]],  [[Adolescence is exploratory|as epitomized by adolescence]]. In simulated annealing, a temperature factor informing how exploratory the search is scheduled to progressively decrease, reducing flexibility as the process is narrowing in on strong solutions. In this, decreasing levels of [[Neuroplasticity enables cross-modal compensation|neuroplasticity]] might be a mechanism underlying a psychological foraging strategy.
