Younger individuals are often faster in their thought process and more accurate in their decisions compared to their older peers. However, this effect appears skewed by low-performers. Most established cognitive functions appear to decline over time, yet the few associated with accumulated knowledge unsurprisingly increase. Knowledge about cognitive function decline trajectories can inform suitable task choice for elderly to be effectively involved in. The digital symbol substitution task is a paradigm often used in the context of cognitive decline, and it resembles a copy-paste procedure based on a look-up table.
