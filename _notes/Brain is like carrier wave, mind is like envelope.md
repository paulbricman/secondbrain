Similar to the [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|computational metaphor of cognition]], a [[Attention distorts time|signal processing metaphor]] of cognition might associate the brain with a carrier wave and the mind with the associated envelope. In signal processing, the carrier wave is a support mechanism which supports information to be expressed through envelope modulate, such as in AM or FM radio transmission.
