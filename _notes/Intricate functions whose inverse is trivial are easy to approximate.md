Downsampling an image is trivial, resulting in [[Predictive world models turn compute into data|plenty of data]] for superresolution. Similarly, a certain neural dipole configuration results in an easy-to-compute observed EEG pattern, which might make it easy to [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|learn]] the inverse mapping.
