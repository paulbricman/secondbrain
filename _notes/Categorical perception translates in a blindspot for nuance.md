If [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|concepts]] fit in [[Concepts are like rooms|neat separate buckets]], then it's [[Contrasting difficulties are like price decoys|difficult]] to [[Explicit position cues describe conceptual structure|find parallels and recycle mental models]].

Could such concepts be explained by [[Bifurcations slice space of dynamical systems in basins|bifurcations structuring neural space]]?
