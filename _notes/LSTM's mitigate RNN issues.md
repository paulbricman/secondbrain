LSTM's mitigate some of the issues of [[Recurrent networks approximate dynamical systems|RNN's]], namely the [[Vanilla RNN's often run into vanishing and exploding gradients|vanishing and exploding gradients]], by introducing some specialized neural ensembles. Through three gates (i.e. input, forget, output), the [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|representations]] stored in the [[Recurrent networks approximate dynamical systems|RNN]] are carefully modulated [[Dynamical systems have memory|across time]].
