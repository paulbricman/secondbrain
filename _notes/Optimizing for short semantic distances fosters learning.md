In the spirit of constructivism, one should strive for finding connections between newly acquired knowledge and previous knowledge through the closest semantic distances. By focusing on leveraging the highest semantic similarities, one is optimally [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|internalizing new knowledge by using existing knowledge as a scaffolding structure]]. An application of this rationale is [[Fluid search enables scaffolding structure for incremental reading|fluid search]].
