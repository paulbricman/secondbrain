In machine learning, even if [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|the training objective seems to be minimizing loss]], in reality the goal is minimizing the statistically expected loss for future examples, termed risk. This is impossible to quantify given the unknown nature of new data, but can be [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|estimated]] with the empirical risk, which is strictly based on existing data.
