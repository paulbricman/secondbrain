[[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|Latent spaces]] can be considered to house both [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|continuous]] and [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|discrete]] operators. For instance, [[Core items are centroids in latent space|(continuous) distance]] is a proxy for [[Fluid search output resembles working memory|semantic similarity]]. In contrast, [[Mental models are constellations|constellations of embeddings]] with their unique topology are [[Semantic embeddings of discrete items are like checkers|discrete arrangements]].
