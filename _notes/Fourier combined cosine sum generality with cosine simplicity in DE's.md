Any [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|function]] can be written as an infinite sum of [[Cosine similarity is magnitude-agnostic|cosines]], or decently approximated through a finite sum of them. What's more, cosines behave very predictably in the [[Differential equations can be ordinary or partial|heat equation]], and those are linear. Therefore, cosine sum approximation of functions makes finding an approximate solution to the heat equation for any given function feasible.
