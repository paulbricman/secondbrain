If [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|concepts are learned]] based on [[Constructivism fosters understanding through scaffolding|previous concepts]], then how could you automatically rank concepts based on how essential or foundational they are? In the [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture|second brain architecture]], this could be done using [[Interpersonal backlinks incentivize collaborative knowledge work|graph-theoretic approaches]]. With a [[Unsupervised learning derives semantics from non-human languages|less structured]] representation, [[Core items are centroids in latent space|centroids could be identified]]. For a more low-tech approach, one could simply track word frequency usage [[Historical lexical semantics capture paradigm shifts|over time]] to infer somewhat of a [[Version control systems empower creatives|concept tree]], a timeline of sequential concepts used as [[Constructivism fosters understanding through scaffolding|building blocks]].
