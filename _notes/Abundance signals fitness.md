How widespread a species is, specifically with respect to other [[Organism and ecology are codetermined|species in its ecological niche]], might be indicative of high fitness. A population which mastered its environment, through metabolic, reproductive, and security  lens, is likely to be abundant in a given ecological niche. However, this time-bound inference is lacking if one considers long-tail existential risks. Abundance should be taken into consideration together with [[Perseverence signals fitness|perseverence]].
