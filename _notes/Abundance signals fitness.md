The abundance of a [[Organism and ecology are codetermined|species]] in its [[Organism and ecology are codetermined|ecological niche]] signals high [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|fitness]]. A [[Particle systems populate spaces with object instances|population]] which mastered its [[Environment have prenatal effects|environment]], through [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|metabolic]], [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|reproductive]], and [[Fragmentation granularity fosters mixing in tea and societies|security]] lens, is likely to be abundant. However, this [[Occam's razor is a heuristic for pruning a solution set|heuristic]] [[Categorical perception translates in a blindspot for nuance|misses]] long-tail [[Risk is statistical expectation of loss|risks]]. Abundance should be considered together with [[Perseverence signals fitness|perseverence]].
