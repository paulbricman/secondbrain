How widespread a species is, specifically with respect to other [[Organism and ecology are codetermined|species in its ecological niche]], might be indicative of high [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|fitness]]. A population which mastered its environment, through [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|metabolic]], [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|reproductive]], and [[Fragmentation granularity fosters mixing in tea and societies|security]] lens, is likely to be abundant in a given ecological niche. However, this [[Occam's razor is a heuristic for pruning a solution set|heuristic]] is [[Categorical perception translates in a blindspot for nuance|blind]] to existential risks. Abundance should be taken into consideration together with [[Perseverence signals fitness|perseverence]].
