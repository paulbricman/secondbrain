Due to the fact that [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|supervised learning assumes an underlying mapping combined with noise]], a larger dataset provides a clearer picture of the underlying function, as the many instances of noise cancel out. In contrast, a smaller dataset doesn't provide the opporunity for the [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|supervised model]] to properly pick out the underlying function from the noise.
