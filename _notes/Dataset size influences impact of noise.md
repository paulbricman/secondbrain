Due to the fact that [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|supervised learning assumes an underlying mapping combined with noise]], a larger [[Rule-based data synthesis renders reverse mapping feasible|dataset]] provides a clearer picture of the underlying function, as the noise components cancel out. In contrast, a smaller dataset doesn't provide the opportunity for the [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|supervised model]] to properly pick out the [[Brains mature through pruning|underlying function from the noise]].
