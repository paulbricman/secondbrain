A dynamical system typically has the following ingredients:
- [[Body states modulate feelings|state]]: the configuration of the system at a give [[Tense logic formalizes time|point in time]]
- [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|trajectory]]: the [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|sequence of states adopted by a system in time]]
- [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|transition function]]: the rule which governs how the system moves from one state to the next, shapes the trajectory
- [[Streams formalize input-output|input]]: signal introduced in the system
- [[Finite-state dynamical systems are diverse|output]]: signal generated by the system
