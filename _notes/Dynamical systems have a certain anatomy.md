A dynamical system typically has the following ingredients:
- [[Body states modulate feelings|state]]: the configuration of the system at a give [[Tense logic formalizes time|point in time]]
- [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|trajectory]]: the sequence of states adopted by a system in time
- transition function: the rule which governs how the system moves from one state to the next, shapes the trajectory
- input: signal introduced in the system
- output: signal generated by the system
