Many have argued that transistors halve in size every couple years, and that quantum mechanical [[Ambiguity promotes creativity|constraints]] will lead to a plateau. However, if one considers [[Momentum in optimization is trend observation in retrospective futurism|previous computing technologies prior to transistors]], one can notice the broader trend of exponentially accelerating computational power, beyond specific technologies. Therefore, Kurzweil's law of accelerated returns extrapolates Moore's law into the future.
