Similar to how [[Historical lexical semantics capture paradigm shifts|semantic embeddings can be used to study variations in meaning over time]], they can also be used to study variations of meaning [[Spacetime bounds memeplexes|across space]]. Essentially, by using [[Unsupervised learning derives semantics from non-human languages|unsupervised learning]] to derive word meaning from different languages, one can quantify properties of various conceptual structures using [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|latent space navigation]]. How close are "money" and "happiness" in various cultures? How strong is the "time is money" [[Metaphor is central to cognition|metaphor]] in different [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|conceptual frameworks]]?
