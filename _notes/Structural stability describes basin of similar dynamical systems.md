If one [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamical system]] can be tweaked so that the resulting [[Attractors and repellors have opposite behaviors in dynamical systems|behavior]] resembles the original one after a [[Linear transformations are perfectly described by matrices|simple transformation]], then the two are structurally stable, forming a stable basin in the space of [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|dynamical systems]].
