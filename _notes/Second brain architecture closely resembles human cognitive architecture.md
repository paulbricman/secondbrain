The [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture|second brain architecture]] closely resembles modern human cognitive architectures. For instance, [[Fluid search output resembles working memory|fluid search output resembles working memory]], [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory|non-linear contents resemble long-term memory]], and [[Second brain buffer is like short-term memory|a transient buffer resembles short-term memory]]. This high-fidelity alignment can enable a functional dialogue through [[Second brain architecture guides cognitive augmentation|guidelines for cognitive augmentation]]. What's more, this close resemblence might have not been a mere coincidence, but the aggregate result of tweaking a note-taking setup in subtle intuitive ways to better [[Evolution is like buying a suit|fit]] human cognition.
