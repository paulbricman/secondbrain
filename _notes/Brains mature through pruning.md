It seems that even if neurogenesis is real, [[Brains are like forests|the brain]] mainly matures by [[Blinding in research is pruning bias-prone predictors in machine learning|pruning]] [[Neural manifold folding explains explanatory drive|neurons and synapses performing poorly in terms of representational power]]. In essence, this indicates that a mature brain is defined by efficiency and increased signal-to-noise ratio, especially in [[Prefrontal cortex matures in the mid twenties|frontal areas]]. However, [[Elderly scaffold neural circuits to compensate for cognitive decline|cognitive decline might reverse the process]].
