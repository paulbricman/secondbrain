It's difficult to accurately compute the trajectory of a rigid object through a fluid. However, with enough examples of various rigid objects moving through the fluid, one can turn the task of physical simulation into a task of data-driven prediction. This has also been applied to [[Modifiers are composable transformations|texturing in 3D modeling]]. Data-driven modeling makes it possible to conduct [[Automated fabrication supports prosumers|automated fabrication]] which keeps track of physical constraints using only scarce computational resources.
