The level of [[Peer pressure modulates autonomic arousal|arousal]] influences [[Brains are like forests|functional brain connectivity]]. This influence leads to changes in the [[Continuous-state dynamical systems share a common structure|dynamics]] of thought. A [[Boltzmann machine is a universal learning machine|sleepy]] person has a less rigid, more fluid [[Forecasting framing renders neural emulation feasible|pattern of thought]]. Conversely, a [[Body seeks homeostasis|stressed]] person is considered to have a rigid, accurate, conventional dynamic. In the context of the [[Neural manifold folding explains explanatory drive|neural manifold hypothesis]], this suggests that metabolic influences alter the [[Manifolds formalize emergence|manifold structure]] and vector field. Additionally, this means that one can intentionally modify their current neural dynamics using [[Agitation can be weaponized|voluntary controls of arousal]] (e.g. through [[Breathwork modulates autonomic arousal|breathwork]] or [[Optic flow modulates autonomic arousal|optic flow]]). In this view, slight [[Boltzmann distribution links macrostates with probability of microstates|temperature]] fluctuations affecting the dynamics of [[Post-digital computing promises superb energy efficiency|neuromorphic]] computing can be seen as a change in metabolism.
