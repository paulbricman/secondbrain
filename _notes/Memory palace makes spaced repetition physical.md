If one's [[Computer vision enables visual mnemonic mining|memory palace]] is populated by [[Optimizing for short semantic distances fosters learning|clusters of related items]], then [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region|physical regions]] would be [[Semantically related notes are conceptual gateways|gateways]] to [[Concepts are like rooms|conceptual regions]].
