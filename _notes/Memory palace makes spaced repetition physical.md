If one's [[Computer vision enables visual mnemonic mining|memory palace]] is populated by [[Optimizing for short semantic distances fosters learning|clusters of related items]], then [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region|physical regions]] would be [[Semantically related notes are conceptual gateways|gateways]] to [[Concepts are like rooms|conceptual regions]]. What's more, scheduling a spaced repetition session turns into the task of computing the optimal physical route for navigating the physical space, the traveling learner problem.
