Antonio Damasio suggests that [[Affect reflects ideological structures|emotion]] is not incompatible with [[Logic frameworks formalize truth|reason]]. He argues that [[Affect reflects ideological structures|emotion]] is essential in [[Logic frameworks formalize truth|reason]], in that it provides [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|useful heuristics driven by gut feelings]] which enable the [[Prototypical reasoning enriches exemplars|reasoner]] to [[Candidate solution overload is a problem|effectively navigate the problem space]]. In this view, [[Prefrontal cortex matures in the mid twenties|prefrontal areas]] run "emotion experiments" based on gut feelings, which are then reported back and taken into consideration during planning and decision making.
