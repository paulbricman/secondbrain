[[Neurotransmitters and hormones are means of biochemical signaling|Biochemically-coded]] information better gets across a [[Medium influences message|channel]] if it's being propagated more aggressively (i.e. more [[Neurotransmitters and hormones are means of biochemical signaling|neurotransmitters and hormones]]). However, the effectiveness of this signaling is also influenced by the receptivity of the recipient (i.e. higher density of receptive structures on [[Neurotransmitters and hormones are means of biochemical signaling|dendrites and throughout the body]]). Varying dendritic receptivity is a function of [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|learning]] through Hebbian plasticity.
