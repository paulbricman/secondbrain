Assuming cognition is the result of a [[Premotor theory of attention is fundamentally enactive|tight sensorimotor loop]] between the [[Perception is context-dependent|percepts]] and [[Phenomenal space is adaptive|actions]] of an individual, evolution suggests that the loop still provides [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|an optimal grip on the world through adaptation]] to ecology. In this way, Darwinism casts enaction in a light of sophisticated realism. However, enaction responds that the plethora of observed adaptations (e.g. various numbers of photoreceptor types), indicates [[World-image is a chicken-egg problem|a disconnect between world and images]].
