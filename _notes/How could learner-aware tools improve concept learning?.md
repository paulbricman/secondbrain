When a tutoring system has access to a learner's [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory|knowledge base]], it can orchestrate [[Concept learning is few-shot scaffolding supported by working memory|concept learning]] so as to best [[Constructivism fosters understanding through scaffolding|build on previous knowledge]]. Learner-aware concept learning is the process of building on [[Constructivism fosters understanding through scaffolding|previous conceptual structures]] in the most efficient way possible, just as an structural engineer keeps track of loads and physical support. In this context, [[Tools for thought interface users with knowledge|tools for thought]] might help the user [[Optimizing for short semantic distances fosters learning|optimize for short semantic distances]]. Additionally, it could automatically come up with [[Explicit position cues describe conceptual structure|explicit position cues]] and [[Natural language inference derives conceptual structure|mental models]] based on [[Constructivism fosters understanding through scaffolding|prior knowledge]]. When new knowledge is also well-structured as a [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory|knowledge base]], additional [[How could core concepts be identified?|graph-theoretic heuristics might guide the optimal path forward]].
