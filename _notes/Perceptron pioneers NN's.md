Rosenblatt's Perceptron model was one of the first [[Neural networks are a massive conceptual gateway|neural network]] models with a [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|learning]] algorithm. An artificial retina is connected to an array of associators which are weighted before being plugged through a non-linear function. However, Rosenblatt hasn't even considered [[Regularization penalizes flexibility|overfitting]] back then.
