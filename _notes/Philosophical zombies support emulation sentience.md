If you can't actually prove or disprove that another human individual is [[Self-model of consciousness mechanizes sentience|sentient]], then why would it be possible to prove or disprove the sentience of a [[Neural emulation simply provides bodily redundancy|neural emulation]]. Specifically, if we take other human individuals as being sentient, why wouldn't we also consider emulations sentient if they don't necessarily provide less evidence. In [[Spacetime bounds life|time]], this extends to recognizing the past as real.
