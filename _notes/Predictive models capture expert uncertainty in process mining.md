[[How can you acquire tacit knowledge effectively?|Expert intuition is tacit]]. A popular way of tapping into that intuition is by [[How can you acquire tacit knowledge effectively?|using expert feedback]]. However, human expert feedback is sparse and non-trivial to obtain. In contrast, [[Tacit knowledge in skill acquisition is dark knowledge in machine learning|dark knowledge]] provides an incredibly accessible framework for [[Latent-variable architecture enables data augmentation through hidden state modulation|capturing uncertainty]]. Considering this, it might be useful to train predictive models to [[Forecasting forces predictive world models to internalize meaningful representations|forecast expert decisions]]. This would lead to a conceptual heatmap of possible actions an expert would take in a situation. Those models would resemble word suggestions when typing. The heatmap contains the expert intuition which the learner might [[How can you acquire tacit knowledge effectively?|seek to make their object of learning]], but made visible.
