In note-taking, many start with a low-effort brain dump and then continue to more constrained [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory|second brain entries]] and eventually to structured pieces of writing. This resembles a foraging strategy with progressively decreasing temperature, just like [[Psychological foraging resembles simulated annealing|simulated annealing]].
