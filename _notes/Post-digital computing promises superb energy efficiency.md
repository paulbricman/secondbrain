In crude approximations, [[Brain is like hardware, mind is like software|the brain]] is orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a [[Digital is pejorative|digital computer]] for the same level of compute. [[Digital is pejorative|Post-digital computing paradigms]] based on other physical elements than transistors (e.g. photonic, quantum, neuromorphic) promise energy efficiency on par with the brain.
