This begs the question: how much of [[Summarization forces understanding|understanding]] and [[Prototypical reasoning enriches exemplars|reasoning]] is strictly a product of [[Memory is perception of structural artifacts|memory]]? This intriguing notion is also supported by the fact that [[Neural networks merge memory and computation|neural networks merge memory and computation]].
