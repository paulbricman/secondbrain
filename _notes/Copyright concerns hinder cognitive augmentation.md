In the short story titled "A Kidnapping", Greg Egan explores the notion of intellectual property and copyright in a world where cognitive augmentation is a mature discipline. Participants invited to an exhibition are searched for neural implants so that they aren't able to record the perceived exhibits with high fidelity. This copyright concern highlights a possible conflict between intellectual property law and cognitive augmentation.
