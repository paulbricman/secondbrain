The grandmother cell hypothesis argues that there are [[Selectively sampling dimensions facilitates manifold definition|cortical neurons which selectively code single specific concepts, such as one's grandmother]]. Those [[Emergent properties are dependent on low-level state|gnostic neurons]] seem to code abstract concepts all by themselves, and [[Multi-modal mappings generate multi-modal receptive fields|respond robustly to variations of that same concept]]. The grandmother cell hypothesis is a perspective of extreme sparsity, compared to views of more interconnected and [[Parallel distributed processing is resilient and efficient|distributed representations]].
