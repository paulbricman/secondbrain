The Bitter Lesson argues that, based on empirical observations of the field, machine learning should focus on developing [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|meta-level learning strategies]], based on which the model would derive the rest, compared to engineering [[Deep learning is consonant with empiricism|symbolic domain-specific knowledge]] into the system. In a similar manner, [[Predestined learning breaks nature-nurture dichotomy|predestined learning helps people derive rich, but similar, worldviews]].
