In Cartesian and cognitive realism, the ideal of the mind is to be a mirror of nature. This coherence between the subject and the object would presumably lead to one being "in touch with reality". However, the apparent lack of direct access to the "outer world" leaves one only with their internal representations, as expressed in idealism. The actual ideal of mind as a mirror of nature leads to what can be described as Cartesian anxiety.
