This metaphor describes the human brain as the combination of a monkey brain and a supercomputer. Subcortical structures are anatomically associated with a monkey brain, while the neocortex is associated with a supercomputer. The brain-monkey-supercomputer metaphor highlights the different "attitudes" typically associated with cortical and subcortical structures. Subcortical structures are stereotypically seen as primitive and savage, while the cortical structures are typically seen as sophisticated and elegant.
