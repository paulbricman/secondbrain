Tense logic is a modal [[Logic frameworks formalize truth|logic]] with four modal operators related to past and future defined in terms of accessibility relations. Time flow direction is based on which world accesses which other world. In tense logic, the accessibility relation stands for "earlier than", meaning that only past worlds can access future worlds.
