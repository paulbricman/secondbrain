One mechanism through which [[Attention is a competition|selective attention]] is suggested to facilitate [[Perception is context-dependent|perception]] is signal enhancement. In signal enhancement, attention presumably [[Brains mature through pruning|amplifies the intensity of relevant stimuli]], making them appear brighter or louder. Besides subjective reporting, signal enhancement induced by selective attention can be observed in [[Brains are like oceans|event-related potentials]] varying in amplitude.
