In most applications, [[Supervised learning assumes underlying structure|machine learning models]], such as [[Feedforward networks approximate functions|simple feedforward networks]] perform [[Few-shot regime enables extreme customization|inference]] by [[Spatial metaphors provide primitives for latent space navigation|interpolating]] the [[Embeddings in machine learning represent prototypes or exemplars|latent space]] derived through [[Pretrained models are universal computation engines|training]]. Therefore, those models have trouble generalizing beyond the domain of [[Risk is statistical expectation of loss|training data]]. Program synthesis, in contrast, attempts to generalize through extrapolation.
