Finite-state [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|dynamical systems]] have discrete states. Some examples include:
- Discrete finite automaton: input and state determines next state
- Moore-machine: like DFA, but with similarly deterministic output emitted
- [[MCMC is feasibe compared to IID sampling|Markov chain]]: like MM, but with [[Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities are primitives of probability theory|probabilistic]] links and no output
- Hidden Markov model: like MC, but with deterministic output
