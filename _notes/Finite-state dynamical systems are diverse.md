Finite-state [[Dynamical systems have a certain anatomy|dynamical systems]] have discrete states. Some examples include:
- DFA: input and state determines next state
- Moore-machine: like DFA, but with similarly deterministic output emitted
- Markov chain: like MM, but with probabilistic links and no output
- Hidden Markov model: like MC, but with deterministic output
