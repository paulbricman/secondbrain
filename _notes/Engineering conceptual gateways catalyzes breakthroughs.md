Transdisciplinary [[Semantically related notes are conceptual gateways|conceptual gateways]], whether [[Conceptual gateways are like bridges|purposefully engineered]] or [[How could learner-aware tools improve concept learning?|automatically devised]], accelerate the circulation of ideas and cross-polination across disparate fields, essentially [[Rich mental model repository is conductive of insight|opening up conceptual silos]]. In doing this, they increase the diversity of the [[Memeplexes resemble grativational attractors|meme pool]] and the selective pressure which [[Meme age signals relevance|memes are subjected to]], resulting in ever more powerful ideas. What's more, they enable the recycling of mental models so that each discipline isn't tasked with coming up with analogous ones on its own. In light of this, conceptual gateway engineering might be a fruitful approach to accelerating scientific inquiry through second-order effects. That said, [[Information hygiene is like spacecraft sanitization|lax information hygiene might lead to memetic extinction]].
