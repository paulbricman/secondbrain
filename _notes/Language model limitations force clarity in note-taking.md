If one plans on using [[Technical knowledge informs tools for thought|AI-informed tools for thought]] in note-taking, one will inevitably face the current limitations of language models. For instance, the [[Fluid search enables scaffolding structure for incremental reading|fluid search is not perfect and requires a human-in-the-loop]]. However, this constraint enforced by the use of machine learning models can be seen as an advantage. If language models work best when phrasing is clear and concise, then this might provide an incentive for the note-taker to take high-quality notes.
