Dynamic attention helps us perceive objects as continuous across time despite their movements. Through indexing and target tracking, it exploits low-level features in order to infuse percepts with coherence, facilitating high-level processing. This is similar to how [[Gaze stabilization is preprocessing in vision|gaze stabilization]] and [[Pupil light response stabilizes luminance on retina|pupil reflexes]] reduce stimuli dimensionality early on. Target tracking in dynamic attention is similar to optic flow in computer vision. The limited sampling frequency of dynamic attention allows for the aliasing phenomenon.
