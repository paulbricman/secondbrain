Certain brain areas seem to differentially fire when interacting with another people in various situations (e.g. negotiation, cooperation, competition). Crucially, those brain areas don't fire when [[Conversational interfaces render knowledge bases into agents|the other agent is a robot]], rather than a human. Therefore, activity in brain regions related to [[Feynman cluster infuses learning by teaching with social structure|social interaction]] and social reasoning might provide the basis of a new Turing Test.
