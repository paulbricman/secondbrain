The brain-building metaphor is focused on the distinction between structure and function. According to this metaphor, brain structure corresponds to the building structure. Additionally, in a similar way a building structure supports various social functions (e.g. work, leisure, etc.), the brain structure supports various cognitive functions (e.g. hope, act, etc.). On a related note, it is the architecture which connects the structure and the function, both for the building and the brain. This idea gave rise to the notion of cognitive architectures.
