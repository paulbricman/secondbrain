There are large text corpora available from various moments in history, especially since the middle of the 20th century. By using an [[Unsupervised learning derives semantics from non-human languages|unsupervised approach]] for deriving word meanings, one can investigate how word meanings change over time, with respect to each other. This is the main interest in historical lexical semantics. What [[Metaphor is central to cognition|metaphors]] did post-war Frence use to make sense of the world? What [[Metaphor is central to cognition|metaphors]] did post-soviet Eastern Europe use to see the world? By keyframing meanings across time, one might observe that meaning dynamics can be approximated with [[Boids approximate crowd kinetics|a trivial model]], albeit in [[Manifolds formalize emergence|high-dimensional space]].
