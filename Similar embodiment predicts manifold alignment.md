If neural activity follows a manifold structure, and it's informed in large part by the environment, then the manifolds corresponding to higher-level cognitive functions should somehow be aligned with manifolds corresponding to lower-level functions. Furthermore, given Minsky's idea of predestined learning, one could infer that because the outside world is similar for individual humans, then their abstractive manifolds are also aligned by virtue of being aligned to the same object.
