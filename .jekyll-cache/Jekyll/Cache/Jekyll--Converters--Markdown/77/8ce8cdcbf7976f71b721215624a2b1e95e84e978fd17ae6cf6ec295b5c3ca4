I"<p>Acquiring tacit knowledge effectively can be seen as the challenge of getting from <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/skill-acquisition-spans-cognitive-associative-autonomous-stages">cognitive to autonomous</a> as fast as possible. In deliberate practice, this transition is facilitated by accelerating instance-based learning <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/skill-acquisition-spans-cognitive-associative-autonomous-stages">from the cognitive to the associative phase</a>. In contrast, learning from expert feedback facilitates tacit knowledge acquisition by accelerating production compilation and utility learning, to use <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">ACT-R formalism</a>. Expert feedback provides a rich signal which captures the expertâ€™s <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/commonsense-is-a-causal-model-repository">intuition</a>, rather than the specifics of the task. Turning expert intuition into the object of learning, rather than the skill itself, appears useful for effectively acquiring tacit knowledge. This is elegantly supported by <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tacit-knowledge-in-skill-acquisition-is-dark-knowledge-in-machine-learning">dark knowledge</a>.</p>
