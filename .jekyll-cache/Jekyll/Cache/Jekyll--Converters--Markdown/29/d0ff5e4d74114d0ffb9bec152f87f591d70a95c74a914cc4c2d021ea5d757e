For instance, a rough heuristic for when to start doing surveys is one week after an event. Similarly, thereâ€™s also a suggested time point which marks a decrease in relevance, suggested at 3 weeks after the event as a guideline. Those oddly specific time points can be seen as specifying propagation dynamics of memes, perhaps being spawned in a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memeplexes-resemble-grativational-attractors">memetic ecosystem</a> and then being assimilated or rendered extinct.
