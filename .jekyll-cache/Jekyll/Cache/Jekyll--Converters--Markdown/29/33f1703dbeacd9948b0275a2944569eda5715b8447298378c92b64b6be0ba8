I"õ<p>Some argue that ambiguity promotes creativity. In an ambiguous representation, be it descriptive, depictive, or otherwise, people seem to ‚Äúsee‚Äù unusual things. Ambiguous stimuli might force perception into unusual inferences, in an effort to bring coherence to the scene. This view seems consonant with the idea of constraints fostering creativity, because the constraints are embedded in ambiguity.</p>
