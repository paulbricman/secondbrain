I"ˆ<p>In the West, freedom refers to the ability to do anything one desires. Interestingly enough, the Buddhist conception of freedom starkly contradicts the Western perspective because desires are seen as behaviorally-induced shackles in the context of the self. In the Buddhist view, freedom refers to the ability of being mindful of the ego and immune to the behavioral drives it spawns.</p>
