<ul>
  <li><strong>Field</strong>: find concepts which are close to a given concept.</li>
  <li><strong>Mix</strong>: find concepts which are close to the center of some given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Span</strong>: find concepts located along the line between two given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift</strong>: determine the directed difference in location between two given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Match</strong>: find constellations of concepts which match the shape of a given constellation of concepts.</li>
