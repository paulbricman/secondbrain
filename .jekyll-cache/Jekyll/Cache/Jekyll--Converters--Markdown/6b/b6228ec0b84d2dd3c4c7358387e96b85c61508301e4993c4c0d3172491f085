I"c<p>Although oversimplified and highly controversial, the triune brain model splits the human brain in three functionally distinct systems based on lose evolutionary criteria. The <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metabolism-influences-neural-dynamics">autonomic nervous system</a> is related to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/breathwork-modulates-autonomic-arousal">primitive behaviors like breathing</a>, and shows up from reptiles on. The <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-monkeys-with-supercomputers">limbic system</a> is tasked with emotions and drives, and shows up from mammals on. The <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-monkeys-with-supercomputers">neocortex</a> is tasked with high-level cognition, and only shows up in humans. However, all levels deeply interact with each other.</p>
