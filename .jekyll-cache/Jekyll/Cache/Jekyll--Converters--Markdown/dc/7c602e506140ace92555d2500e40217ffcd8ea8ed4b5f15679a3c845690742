I"c<p>It turns out that in machine learning, the task of abstractive summarization (i.e. writing a summary of a piece of content in your own words) is much more computationally involved than extractive summarization (i.e. extracting the central parts of a piece of content). This fact highlights the (beneficial) elaborative load of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/summarization-forces-understanding">abstractive summarization</a>. This supports the value of the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feynman-cluster-infuses-learning-by-teaching-with-social-structure">Feynman technique</a>.</p>
