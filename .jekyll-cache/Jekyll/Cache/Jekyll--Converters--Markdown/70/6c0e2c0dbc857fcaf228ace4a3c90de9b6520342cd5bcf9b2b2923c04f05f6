I"<p>In virtual and augmented reality, abstract concepts can be grounded in tangible objects. For instance, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/first-person-projection-is-intuitive-in-programming">in programming</a>, a code library can become an actual physical library, a game tree can be an actual tree, calling a function can involve a phone. Whatâ€™s more, virtual reality provides the necessary context for attempting to make any abstract concepts tangible, in an effort to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-movement-supports-spatial-reasoning">infuse them with embodied knowledge</a>, forcing <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/dynamic-attention-enables-object-permanence">a host of cognitive functions</a> to be applied to the same concept.</p>
