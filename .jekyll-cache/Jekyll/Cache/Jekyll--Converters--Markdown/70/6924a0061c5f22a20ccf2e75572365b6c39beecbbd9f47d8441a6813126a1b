I"0<p>A dynamical system typically has the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>[[Body states modulate feelings</td>
          <td>state]]: the configuration of the system at a give [[Tense logic formalizes time</td>
          <td>point in time]]</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>[[Phenomenal space is adaptive</td>
          <td>trajectory]]: the sequence of states adopted by a system in time</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>transition function: the rule which governs how the system moves from one state to the next, shapes the trajectory</li>
  <li>input: signal introduced in the system</li>
  <li>output: signal generated by the system</li>
</ul>
