I"z<p>The traditional spaced repetition paradigm treats items as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/context-independent-strategies-are-like-good-chess-moves">independent units</a> which have to be approached and learned individually. However, the human mind arguably contains <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/categorical-perception-translates-in-a-blindspot-for-other-taxonomies">no clear-cut distinctions between such items</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/rich-mental-model-repository-is-conductive-of-insight">deeply integrates them in an interconnected web of knowledge</a>. Therefore, spaced repetition systems could integrate notions of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/optimizing-for-short-semantic-distances-fosters-learning">semantic relatedness between the items being learned</a>, leading to a new paradigm of sense repetition.</p>
