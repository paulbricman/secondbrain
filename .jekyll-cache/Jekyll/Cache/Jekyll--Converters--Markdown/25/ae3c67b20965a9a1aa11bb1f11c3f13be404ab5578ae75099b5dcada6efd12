I"ı<p>Assuming one‚Äôs ideological mark-up can be viewed as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memetic-probing-can-be-conducted-through-a-wide-range-of-techniques">a finite collection of interconnected beliefs</a>, it is possible to make a parallel between the internalization of beliefs and the idea of debt. When internalizing a belief, one is ‚Äúbuying into it‚Äù based on <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cognitive-dissonance-reduction-drive-influences-body-state">coherence</a> with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">prior beliefs</a>. However, by ‚Äúbuying into‚Äù a plethora of mutually-compatible beliefs in a craving for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-manifold-folding-explains-explanatory-drive">explanatory power</a>, one is essentially getting into debt. The ideological debt parallel highlights the fact that a mutually-reinforced belief structure is especially rigid and inflexible to perturbations. Accumulating ideological debt hurdles the explorative dimension of memetic foraging. This mindset narrowing resembles <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metabolism-influences-neural-dynamics">rigidity induced by arousal</a>.</p>
