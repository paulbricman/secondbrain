I".<p>Phenomenological transparency refers to the experience of a tool being part of your body. Drivers extend their <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conscious-awareness-modulates-neural-activity">situational awareness</a> to that of their car. Phenomeneological transparency and the mechanisms which presumably support it might be the foundation of affordances. However, it seems to be <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/motor-cortex-magnifies-by-function-not-structure">proportional to the fluency of using tools</a>. With a strong <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/premotor-theory-of-attention-is-fundamentally-enactive">enactive and premotor attitude</a>, one could envision a phenomenological theory of affordances which might integrate with James Gibsonâ€™s model. The phenomenology of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tools-for-thought-interface-users-with-knowledge">tools for thought and their affordances</a> provides a particularly intriguing line of inquiry. Interestingly enough, this suggests that tools get <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cognitive-augmentation-is-morally-unambiguous-when-rehabilitative">on equal footing</a> with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-emulation-simply-provides-bodily-redundancy">other parts of the body</a>.</p>
