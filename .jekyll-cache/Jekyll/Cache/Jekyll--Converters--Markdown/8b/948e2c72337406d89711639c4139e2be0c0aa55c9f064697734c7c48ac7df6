      <td>The von Neumann architecture marks a clear distinction between memory and computation. This, however, leads to the von Neumann bottleneck, because information has to continuously be brought back and forth between memory components and computational compontents. In contrast, neural networks merge [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory</td>
