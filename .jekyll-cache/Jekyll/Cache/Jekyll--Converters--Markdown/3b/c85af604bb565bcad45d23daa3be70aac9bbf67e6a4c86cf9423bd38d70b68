I"0<p>The brain-forest metaphor highlights the resilient and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/parallel-distributed-processing-is-resilient-and-efficient">distributed</a> nature of the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-oceans">brain</a>. Neurons are trees which form a forest. Cut down one tree, and the forest recovers. Trees form networks linked by fungi just like neurons form networks linked by synapses. Additionally, it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees, and focus on individual neurons as the key to engineering <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/lstms-mitigate-rnn-issues">AI</a>, whereas the aggregate “forest” <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-dynamicity-has-evolutionary-advantages">dynamics</a> might be a more fertile approach.</p>
