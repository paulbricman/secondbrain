I"Ê<p>The cluster index uses the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/constructivism-fosters-understanding-through-scaffolding">internal connectivity</a> of a subgraph together with its <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/interpersonal-backlinks-incentivize-collaborative-knowledge-work">external connectivity</a> to determine how much of an isolated cluster said subgraph is. This is an abstract instrument, and can be used from anything ranging from <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/knowledge-graph-connectivity-quantifies-knowledge-work">knowledge graphs</a> to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/selectively-sampling-dimensions-facilitates-manifold-definition">neurons</a>.</p>
