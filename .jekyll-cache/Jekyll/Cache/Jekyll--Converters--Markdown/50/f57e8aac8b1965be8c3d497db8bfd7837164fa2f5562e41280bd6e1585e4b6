I"<p>The brain-mind as hardware-software metaphor highlights the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/world-models-reflect-ideological-structures">computational aspect</a> (carrier, vehicle) of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mind-mind-problem-decouples-cognition-and-experience">cognition</a> (envelope, contents). Similar to the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-buildings">brain-building metaphor</a>, it highlights the relation between brain structure and function. However, this <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metaphor-is-central-to-cognition">metaphor implies</a> that cognition can be studied independently of the brain (i.e. just like software can be studied while abstracting away from hardware), which many scholars contest.</p>
