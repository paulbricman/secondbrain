I",<p>Some argue that ambiguity promotes <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creativity-is-based-on-search-not-generation">creativity</a>. In an ambiguous representation, be it <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/multi-modal-encoders-enable-cross-modal-guidance-in-latent-space">descriptive, depictive</a>, or otherwise, people seem to “see” unusual things. Ambiguous stimuli might force <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">perception</a> into unusual inferences, in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/glom-enables-hierarchical-representations-in-continuous-spaces">an effort to bring coherence to the scene</a>. This view seems consonant with the idea of constraints fostering creativity, because the constraints are embedded in ambiguity.</p>
