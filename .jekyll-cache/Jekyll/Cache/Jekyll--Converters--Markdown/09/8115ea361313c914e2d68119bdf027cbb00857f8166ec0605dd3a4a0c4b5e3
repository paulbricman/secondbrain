I"³<p>In 3D modeling, particle systems repeatedly instantiate an object and treat each instance in a slightly different way. The particles being generated belong to the same family, yet are uniquely modified across a small subset of attribute dimensions. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/selectively-sampling-dimensions-facilitates-manifold-definition">Those variable attributes alone can describe the particle system</a>.</p>
