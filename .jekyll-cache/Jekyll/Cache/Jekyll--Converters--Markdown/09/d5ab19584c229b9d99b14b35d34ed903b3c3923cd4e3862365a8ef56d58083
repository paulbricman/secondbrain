Especially when acquiring <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tacit-knowledge-in-skill-acquisition-is-dark-knowledge-in-machine-learning">tacit knowledge</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/predictive-models-capture-expert-uncertainty-in-process-mining">mentors</a> are crucial. In light of this, a skill exchange can be set up so that students â€œleechâ€ (i.e. acquire skills), while mentors â€œseedâ€ (i.e. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/skill-acquisition-spans-cognitive-associative-autonomous-stages">teach skills</a>). Naturally, all users can do both at the same time with different skills, because most people have something to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feynman-cluster-infuses-learning-by-teaching-with-social-structure">teach</a>.</p>
