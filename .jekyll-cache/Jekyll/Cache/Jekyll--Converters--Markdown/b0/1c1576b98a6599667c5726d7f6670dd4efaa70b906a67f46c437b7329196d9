I"|<p>In self-supervised learning, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/recovery-and-matching-provide-self-supervised-signals">models are trained to recover patterns</a>, which resembles using a form of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memory-can-be-content-based-or-location-based">content-based memory</a>. This begs the question: how much of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/summarization-forces-understanding">understanding</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/prototypical-reasoning-enriches-exemplars">reasoning</a> is strictly a product of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memory-is-perception-of-structural-artifacts">memory</a>? This intriguing notion is also supported by the fact that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-networks-merge-memory-and-computation">neural networks merge memory and computation</a>.</p>
