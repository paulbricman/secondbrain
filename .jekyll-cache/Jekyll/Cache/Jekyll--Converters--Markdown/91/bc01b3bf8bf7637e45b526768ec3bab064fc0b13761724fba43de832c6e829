I"`<p>Traditionally, cognitive magnification refers to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/abundance-signals-fitness">more brain tissue being allocated</a> to the processing of important aspects of stimuli. However, this magnification can also take place across <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tense-logic-formalizes-time">time</a>. Through a change in the attentional “sampling rate”, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/dynamic-attention-enables-object-permanence">dynamic attention</a> can induce distortions of subjective time as more information is being processed, similar to how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-and-motor-action-distort-spatial-representation">motor action distorts space perception</a>. Attention-induced time distortions are conceptually similar to periods of overclocking on a CPU.</p>
