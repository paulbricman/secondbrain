I"ê<p>Argmin and argmax are functions which iterate over a set of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/candidate-solution-overload-is-a-problem">candidate solutions</a> to find the best ones as scored by a given attached function. In this, the two operators <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/risk-is-statistical-expectation-of-loss">formalize the training objective</a> in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">supervised learning</a>, among countless other optimization tasks. Varying the size of the hypothesis space for optimization can be seen as a way of manipulating <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/regularization-penalizes-flexibility">flexibility</a>.</p>
