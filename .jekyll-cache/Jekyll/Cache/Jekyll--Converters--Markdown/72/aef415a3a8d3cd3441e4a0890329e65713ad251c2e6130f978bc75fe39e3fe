I"v<p><a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">High-dimensional space provides increased expressivity for points</a> through complex relationships, more so than simply considering a list of linear axes. However, the manifold hypothesis claims that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-manifold-folding-explains-explanatory-drive">the high-dimensional space is rarely populated in its entirety</a>, and only houses points across a manifold. This double constraint can be expressed as the fact that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, but less than the (Cartesian) product.</p>
