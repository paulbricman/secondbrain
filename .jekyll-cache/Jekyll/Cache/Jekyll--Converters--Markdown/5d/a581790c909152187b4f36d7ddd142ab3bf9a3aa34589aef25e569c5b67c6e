I"<p>Emergent properties of a system can often be seen as approximate macrolevel descriptions of the low level. In this view, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">emerging symbolic representations</a> in a neural network would be closely linked to the resonant dynamics of the network itself. In inclusive emergence, symbolic representations derived from distributed neural activity canâ€™t be properly tackled independently, contrary to what has been tried with syntax trees, for instance. A good parallel for inclusive emergence in cognition is genetic coding. In genetic coding, DNA structures do code for specific aminoacids, but only in the context of a complex distributed metabolic system which resides in the background of such symbols.</p>
