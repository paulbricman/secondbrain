I"-<p>The brain-forest metaphor highlights the resilient and distributed nature of the brain. It associates individual neurons with individuals trees which form a forest. Cut down one tree, and the forest will heal and recover. Trees form networks linked by fungi in a similar way neurons are interconnected. Additionally, itâ€™s easy to miss the forest for the trees, and focus on replicating individual neurons as the key to creating truly intelligent artifacts, whereas modeling the aggregate dynamics of the forest might be a much more suitable level.</p>
