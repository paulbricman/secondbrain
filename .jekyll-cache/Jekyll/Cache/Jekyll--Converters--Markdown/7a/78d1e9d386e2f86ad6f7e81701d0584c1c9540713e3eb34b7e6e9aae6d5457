I"÷<p>Imagine a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/semantic-hash-tables-enable-fuzzy-key-value-storage">semantic hash table</a> which contains sentence embeddings as keys and contact details as values. The embedded sentences can be questions <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/validation-through-creation-quantifies-free-learning">free learners</a> are thinking about and are trying to answer. By <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spatial-metaphors-provide-primitives-for-latent-space-navigation">finding close inquiries in semantic space</a>, this system could connect free learners whose learning objectives are <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/alignment-is-reflexive-symmetric-and-transitive">aligned</a>. Such a system might be part of the puzzle of building infrastructure for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creative-output-can-support-educational-input-in-free-learning">free learning</a>, specifically tackling Ivan Illichâ€™s point of peer match-making.</p>
