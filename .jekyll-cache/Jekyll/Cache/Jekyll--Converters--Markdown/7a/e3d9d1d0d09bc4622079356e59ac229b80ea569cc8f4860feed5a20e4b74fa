I"4<p><a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/how-can-you-acquire-tacit-knowledge-effectively">Expert intuition is tacit</a>. A popular way of tapping into that intuition is by <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/how-can-you-acquire-tacit-knowledge-effectively">using expert feedback</a>. However, human expert feedback is sparse and non-trivial to obtain. In contrast, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tacit-knowledge-in-skill-acquisition-is-dark-knowledge-in-machine-learning">dark knowledge</a> provides an incredibly accessible framework for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/latent-variable-architecture-enables-data-augmentation-through-hidden-state-modulation">capturing uncertainty</a>. Considering this, it might be useful to train predictive models to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/forecasting-forces-predictive-world-models-to-internalize-meaningful-representations">forecast expert decisions</a>. This would lead to a conceptual heatmap of possible actions an expert would take in a situation. Those models would resemble word suggestions when typing. The heatmap contains the expert intuition which the learner might <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/how-can-you-acquire-tacit-knowledge-effectively">seek to make their object of learning</a>, but made visible.</p>
