By controlling light sources and projections, a biotic programmer can change the behavior of the organism in computationally useful ways. Similarly, biotic games are based on coordinating microorganisms to achieve certain arbitrary goals. What’s more, biotic server farms make biotic computing accessible, through [[Elderly scaffold neural circuits to compensate for cognitive decline</td>
