I"W<p>Due to its <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-architecture-closely-resembles-human-cognitive-architecture">high-fidelity resemblance of human cognitive architectures</a>, the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">second brain architecture</a> can guide the development of tools for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cognitive-augmentation-is-morally-unambiguous-when-rehabilitative">cognitive augmentation</a>. Through <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-architecture-closely-resembles-human-cognitive-architecture">clear parallels with the human mind</a>, it can provide a humanistic framework for dialogue between mind and machine. Separate human cognitive functions can interact with specific aspects of the second brain, mutually supporting each other. The representational synchrony enabled by the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-architecture-closely-resembles-human-cognitive-architecture">close parallels</a> place the second brain “on the same page” with its user.</p>
