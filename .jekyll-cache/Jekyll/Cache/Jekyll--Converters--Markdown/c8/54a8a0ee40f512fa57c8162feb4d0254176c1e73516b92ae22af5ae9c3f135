I"y<p>Any <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feedforward-networks-approximate-functions">function</a> can be written as an infinite sum of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cosine-similarity-is-magnitude-agnostic">cosines</a>, or decently approximated through a finite sum of them. Whatâ€™s more, cosines behave very predictably in the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/differential-equations-can-be-ordinary-or-partial">heat equation</a>, and those are linear. Therefore, cosine sum approximation of functions makes finding an approximate solution to the heat equation for any given function feasible.</p>
