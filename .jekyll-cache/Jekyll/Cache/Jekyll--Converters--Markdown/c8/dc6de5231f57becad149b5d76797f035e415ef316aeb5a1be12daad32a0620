I"^<p>First-principles thinking aims at expanding the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/candidate-solution-overload-is-a-problem">solution space</a> as much as possible, by challenging as many assumptions as possible limiting it. In contrast, zeroth-principles thinking aims at infinitely expanding the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/machine-learning-often-finds-surprising-solutions">solution space</a> by attempting to ignore all assumptions. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/candidate-solution-overload-is-a-problem">the first is cheaper than the latter</a>.</p>
