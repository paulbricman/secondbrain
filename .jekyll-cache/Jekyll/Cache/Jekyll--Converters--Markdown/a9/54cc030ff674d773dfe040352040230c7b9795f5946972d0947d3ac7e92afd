I"t<p>Many have argued that transistors halve in size every couple years, and that quantum mechanical <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/ambiguity-promotes-creativity">constraints</a> will lead to a plateau. However, if one considers <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/momentum-in-optimization-is-trend-observation-in-retrospective-futurism">previous computing technologies prior to transistors</a>, one can notice the broader trend of exponentially accelerating computational power, beyond specific technologies. Therefore, Kurzweil’s law of accelerated returns extrapolates Moore’s law into the future.</p>
