I"°<p>If you use the many small decisions made by a crowd to inform a search process through a latent space, you can approximate convex optimization. Optimizer-specific dynamics such as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/momentum-in-optimization-is-trend-observation-in-retrospective-futurism">momentum</a> can also be integrated to determine <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/continuous-user-signal-provides-rich-feedback-for-navigating-latent-spaces">user prompts</a> for optimal convergence. In the case of a creative task, this is consonant with the view of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creativity-is-based-on-search-not-generation">creativity as search</a>. That said, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/human-api-pushes-crowdsourcing-on-the-tech-stack">crowdsourcing</a> might also be useful for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/optimization-is-not-open-ended">open-ended tasks</a>.</p>
