I"ö<p>In his short story titled ‚ÄúStable Orbits in the Space of Lies‚Äù, Greg Egan draws a superb analogy between <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">belief internalization</a> and gravitational <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/continuous-state-dynamical-systems-share-a-common-structure">attractors</a>. Essentially, he argues that each ideology, each <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">mutually-reinforcing belief structure</a>, each memeplex, is akin to a massive celestial object in space. Once ideologically close to a memeplex, it‚Äôs difficult to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/axiomatic-implants-depict-memetic-psychotherapy">rationalize</a> your way out. What‚Äôs more, memetic protectionism might be an attractor in its own right, due to the stable orbit which underlies it.</p>
