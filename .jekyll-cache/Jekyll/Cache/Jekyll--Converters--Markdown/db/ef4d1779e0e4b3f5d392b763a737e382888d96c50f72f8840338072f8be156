I"“<p>When dealing with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/continuous-state-dynamical-systems-share-a-common-structure">continuous spaces</a>, itâ€™s often useful to discretize them to be able to use the advanced mathematical machinery available for discrete systems. This can be done with meshing, a family of techniques for performing this <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">mapping</a>. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/discrete-structure-embeddings-in-continuous-space-are-glitchy">discrete-continuous transformations are glitchy</a> and inevitably result in error.</p>
