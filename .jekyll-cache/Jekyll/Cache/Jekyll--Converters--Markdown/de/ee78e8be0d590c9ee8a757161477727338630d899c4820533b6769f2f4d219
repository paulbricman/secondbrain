I"«<p>Joint probability is the probability of two <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/subscribe-notify-pattern-streamlines-event-handling">events</a> occurring at the same time. Marginal probability is the probability of an <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/selective-attention-amplifies-event-related-potential">event</a> occurring regardless of events across <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/particle-systems-populate-spaces-with-object-instances">other dimensions</a>. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring in the limited bracket of another event occurring. Those provide a framework for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/kl-divergence-formalizes-difference-between-discrete-probability-distributions">probability</a>, just like <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tense-logic-formalizes-time">tense logic provides a framework for events unfolding in time</a>.</p>
