I"F<p>Initially, when learning a skill, it is performed in a state of acute awareness. All details have to be carefully considered in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">working memory</a>, with high error rates and response times. However, after a number of learning episodes, the skill transitions to the associative phase, where <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-contents-resemble-long-term-memory">episodic memory</a> is used for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/explicit-position-cues-describe-conceptual-structure">pattern matching</a>, remembering answers with lower error rates and response times. After even more episodes, the skill becomes autonomous and reflex-like, stored procedurally rather than declaratively.</p>
