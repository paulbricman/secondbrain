The consuming conflict can spark anxiety, which manifests vividly from the cognitive to the behavioral domain. In contrast, a sudden increase in belief <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">coherence</a> results in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/beliefs-are-gates-into-the-body-s-biochemistry">a pleasant feeling</a>. Therefore, the spontaneous emotional response can be seen as a sparse signal into oneâ€™s ideological structures. This signal can inform a number of cognitive-based psychotherapies. This idea closely reflects reverse appraisal theory, which argues that oneâ€™s emotional response is a function of how their beliefs, desires, and intentions interact with the state of the world.</p>
