I"h<p>Certain brain areas seem to differentially fire when interacting with another people in various situations (e.g. negotiation, cooperation, competition). Crucially, those brain areas donâ€™t fire when <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conversational-interfaces-render-knowledge-bases-into-agents">the other agent is a robot</a>, rather than a human. Therefore, activity in brain regions related to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feynman-cluster-infuses-learning-by-teaching-with-social-structure">social interaction</a> and social reasoning might provide the basis of a new Turing Test.</p>
