I"<p>Wikipediaâ€™s policy is that the minimum requirement for inclusion of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creative-output-can-support-educational-input-in-free-learning">content</a> is that it can be verified through a third-party resource, rather than having to clearly be true. This makes it more accessible for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/version-control-systems-empower-creatives">users to contribute</a>. SImilarly, if a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conversational-interfaces-render-knowledge-bases-into-agents">virtual assistant</a> also had <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/few-shot-regime-enables-extreme-customization">generative capabilities</a>, then verifiability as a content policy might set useful expectations.</p>
