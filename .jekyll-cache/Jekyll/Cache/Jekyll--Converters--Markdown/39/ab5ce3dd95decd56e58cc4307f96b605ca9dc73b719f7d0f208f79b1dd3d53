I"º<p>One mechanism through which <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/attention-is-a-competition">selective attention</a> is suggested to facilitate <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">perception</a> is signal enhancement. In signal enhancement, attention presumably <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-mature-through-pruning">amplifies the intensity of relevant stimuli</a>, making them appear brighter or louder. Besides subjective reporting, signal enhancement induced by selective attention can be observed in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-oceans">event-related potentials</a> varying in amplitude.</p>
