I""<p>Just like the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conceptual-gateways-are-like-wormholes">conceptual gateway-wormhole metaphor</a>, the conceptual gateway-bridge metaphor also highlights the fact that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/semantically-related-notes-are-conceptual-gateways">conceptual gateways enable the circulation of ideas across disparate domains</a>. However, associating them with bridges also highlights the fact that they have to be built, they have to be actively sought and engineered. This enables the creation of a social role for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/rich-mental-model-repository-is-conductive-of-insight">interdisciplinary</a> scholars in academia: bridge builders. Alternatives to bridges might be subways or secret passages.</p>
