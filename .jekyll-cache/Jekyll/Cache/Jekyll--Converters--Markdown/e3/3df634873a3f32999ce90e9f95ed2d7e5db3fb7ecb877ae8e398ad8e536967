I"Ù<p>If neural activity follows a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">manifold structure</a>, and itâ€™s informed in large part by the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-and-motor-action-distort-spatial-representation">environment</a>, then the manifolds corresponding to higher-level cognitive functions should somehow be aligned with manifolds corresponding to lower-level functions. Furthermore, given Minskyâ€™s idea of predestined learning, one could infer that because <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/experientialism-breaks-the-subjectivism-objectivism-dichotomy">the outside world is similar for individual humans</a>, then their <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/emergent-properties-are-dependent-on-low-level-state">abstractive manifolds</a> are also aligned by virtue of being <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-code-relative-object-positions">aligned to the same object</a>.</p>
