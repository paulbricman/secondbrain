I"p<p>When highly salient stimuli are deemed important to act on, they are usually sent to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/triune-brain-model-classifies-brain-regions-through-evolutionary-lens">subcortical limbic structures</a> before being sent to the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/triune-brain-model-classifies-brain-regions-through-evolutionary-lens">neocortex</a>, in an effort to gain speed. However, a shortcut to the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-monkeys-with-supercomputers">subcortical</a> means that processing accuracy is lower. Taking out a phone can be misinterpreted as a taking out a gun. The speed-accuracy trade-off of subcortical shortcuts often results in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cortical-subcortical-conflict-generates-limbic-friction">internal friction which is resolved later</a>.</p>
