I"ê<p>Contrary to what <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/representationism-in-cognition-is-adaptationism-in-evolution">adaptationism would predict</a>, evolution is not a gradual change of traits in an optimization process, but is punctuated with sudden discontinuities. This is consonant with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/pleiotropy-challenges-adaptationism">pleiotropy</a>, in that it highlights the internal constraints of an organism guiding its own evolutionary trajectory. Itâ€™s not trivial to move out of local optima in evolution, and it requires a coordinated and unlikely choreography of changes across multiple domains. However, those unlikely shifts correspond to the observed discontinuities in evolution.</p>
