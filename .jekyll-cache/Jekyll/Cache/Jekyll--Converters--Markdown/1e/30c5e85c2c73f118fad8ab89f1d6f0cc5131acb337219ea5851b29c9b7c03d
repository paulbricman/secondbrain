      <td>Participants consistently make hand gestures when tasked with memorizing a spatial configuration. Artificially supressing hand gesturing leads to a decrease in performance. Those body movements performed during reasoning accurately reflect the representations being manipulated, especially their relative configuration. Surprisingly, blind people also gesture.
