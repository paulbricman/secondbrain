I"/<p>Many pieces of malware have mechanisms for detecting whether they have been placed in a sandbox for further analysis. When sandboxing is detected, they typically self-distruct by deletion or corruption, in order to avoid being studied and reverse engineered. Similarly, in the short story titled “There Is No Antimemetics Division”, a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/lax-information-hygiene-norms-beg-memetic-attacks">meme</a> is described which when <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conscious-awareness-modulates-neural-activity">consciously registered</a>, it triggers some debilitating reactions, avoiding mental examination. Alternatively, it is simply forgotten, yet this would be <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/meme-age-signals-relevance">counterproductive</a>.</p>
