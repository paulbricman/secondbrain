      <td>[[Metabolism influences neural dynamics]]. During sleep, the body operates on an arguably different metabolism compared to waking, exhibiting typical brain states. Therefore, neural dynamics are different during sleep. Dreaming may be an evolutionary response to this [[Agitation can be weaponized</td>
