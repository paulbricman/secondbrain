I"<p>Individuals are more than a list of attributes encoded in their genome. Changes in a phenotypic trait are most often associated with a coordinated <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">non-linear change in multiple genes</a>. It is rare that one isolated gene codes for a specific trait, rather traits are often polygenic, with decreasing levels of explained variance as one is considering more <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/genes-are-like-recipes-for-proteins">genes involved</a>.</p>
