I"ç<p>The brain-building metaphor highlights the distinction between brain structure and function. Brain structure corresponds to building structure. Additionally, just like a building supports social functions (e.g. work, leisure, etc.), the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brain-is-like-hardware-mind-is-like-software">brain supports various cognitive functions</a> (e.g. hope, act, etc.). It is architecture which connects structure and function, both for the building and the brain. This idea gave rise to the notion of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">cognitive architectures</a>.</p>
