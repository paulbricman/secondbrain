I"…<p>Neurotransmitters facilitate information propagation <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-forests">across the synaptic cleft, between axon terminals and dendrites</a>. In contrast, hormones propagate information throughout the body. Neurotransmitters operate <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brain-is-like-hardware-mind-is-like-software">over the course of milliseconds</a>, while hormones operate over the course of hours, days, or even years. Neurotransmitters generally only excite or inhibit neurons, while hormones are incredibly versatile in their effects. Both are means of biochemical signaling.</p>
