High-level cognitive architectures (i.e. closer to ACT-R rather than Nengo), typically consist of modules associated with cognitive functions (e.g. declarative memory, vision) which are related to brain regions (e.g. PFC, visual cortex). However, the second brain configuration resembles a general cognitive architecture. It consists of various modules (e.g. [[Second brain contents resemble long-term memory</td>
