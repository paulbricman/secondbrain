I"o<p>How widespread a species is, specifically with respect to other <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/organism-and-ecology-are-codetermined">species in its ecological niche</a>, might be indicative of high fitness. A population which mastered its environment, through metabolic, reproductive, and security  lens, is likely to be abundant in a given ecological niche. However, this time-bound inference is lacking if one considers long-tail existential risks. Abundance should be taken into consideration together with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perseverence-signals-fitness">perseverence</a>.</p>
