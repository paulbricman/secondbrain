I"I<p>Traditionally, when having to find a local optimum in a high-dimensional latent space, such as when editing a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/modifiers-are-composable-transformations">3D model</a> or an image, users would sequentially select from several alternatives (e.g. 2GC, 4GC), informing the search process. However, a continuous signal (e.g. through a slider) offers faster convergence of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creativity-is-based-on-search-not-generation">the search process</a> and better results, even with the slight time overhead.</p>
