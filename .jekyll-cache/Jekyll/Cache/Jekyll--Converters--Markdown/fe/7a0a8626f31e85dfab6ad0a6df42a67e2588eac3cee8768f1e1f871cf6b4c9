I"I<p>Constructivism in education refers to the focus on <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-buildings">building on</a> prior knowledge when learning new things. Given the fact that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">concept learning is based on few-shot scaffolding</a>, it’s easy to see how constructivism can be an essential tool in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/summarization-forces-understanding">fostering understanding</a>. The main reason why <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/interpersonal-backlinks-incentivize-collaborative-knowledge-work">backlinks</a> are useful is that they essentially signal “many <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">concepts</a> build on this!” There is no one Dockerfile which describes the unique set of rules necessary to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">internalize a certain concept</a>.</p>
