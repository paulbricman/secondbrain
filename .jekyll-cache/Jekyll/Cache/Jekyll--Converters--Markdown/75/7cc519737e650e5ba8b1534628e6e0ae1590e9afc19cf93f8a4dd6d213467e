I"-<p>Neuroscience sheds light on rhythms of neural activity and information processing in the brain. These findings are closely related to the timing of various events in the recurring <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/world-models-reflect-ideological-structures">cascade</a> of sensation, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">perception</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/dynamic-attention-enables-object-permanence">attention</a>, and awareness. The rhythms of neural activity appear compatible with the meditative insights into the momentariness of experience, and may provide a neuroscientific basis for it. The momentariness of experience is related to the seemingly fleeting and transient clouds of sensations which form our conscious life.</p>
