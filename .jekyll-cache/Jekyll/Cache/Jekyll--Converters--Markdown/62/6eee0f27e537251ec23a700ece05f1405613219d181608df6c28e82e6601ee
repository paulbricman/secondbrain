I"><p>Parallel distributed processing (PDP) models have been suggested as a solution to the flaws of centralized symbolic models. The von Neumann bottleneck refers to the extensive time complexity of algorithms forced through a sequential architecture. By attempting to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/experiential-consequences-of-cognitivism">parallelize cognition</a>, PDP enables more efficient models, which often better reflect human performance. Additionally, due to its distributed nature, PDP is more resilient to accidents, malfunctions, or mutations.</p>
