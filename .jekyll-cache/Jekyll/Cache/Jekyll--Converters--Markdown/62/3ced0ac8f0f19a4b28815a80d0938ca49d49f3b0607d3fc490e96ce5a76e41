I"B<p>The neural systems which regulate reward are internal to one’s body. There is usually no external injection of dopamine involved in the process of rewarding a behavior. The entire neural apparatus involved in differentially rewarding behaviors is intimately tied to one’s <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/thinking-is-traveling">own thought process</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">belief system</a>. Even if some aspects seem to be innately selected for (e.g. food, sex, community), it seems like nurture can significantly modulate the reward system, essentially redefining the optimization function of the individual. As opposed to most machine learning models, the optimization function of biological individuals seems fundamentally malleable.</p>
