I"†<p><a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mcmc-is-feasibe-compared-to-iid-sampling">MCMC samplers</a> are based on informed walks in the population space. The Metropolis sampler is a specific <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mcmc-is-feasibe-compared-to-iid-sampling">MCMC sampler</a> based on effective heuristics. At each sampled point, a (local) <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/boltzmann-distribution-links-macrostates-with-microstate-probabilities">proposal distribution</a> is used to sample the next one. The candidate point is accepted with an acceptance probability determined by the PDF values of the two.</p>
