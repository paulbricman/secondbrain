      <td>Temporal attention is analogous to [[Spatial attention is effector-agnostic, movement intention is effector-specific</td>
      <td>spatial attention]]. Spatial cues can prime participants in attending to a certain location in space. Conversely, temporal cues can prime participants in attenting to stimuli occuring at certain moments in time. Rhythm is a temporal cue which guides the deployment of attentional resources at regular intervals. Expectation priming also influences attention deployment through increased sampling frequency and earlier onset. Spatial cue-like temporal cues also bias attention. Attentional blink refers to an attentional blindspot a little after initial deployment. Spatial and temporal attention are based on different brain regions and mechanism, even though they interact.</td>
