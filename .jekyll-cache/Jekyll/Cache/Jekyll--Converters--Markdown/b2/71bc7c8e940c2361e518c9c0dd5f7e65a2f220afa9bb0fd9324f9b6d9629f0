I"Y<p>Metaphor can be seen as something much more central to thought than a colorful figure of speech in literature. Metaphorical thought helps us find <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/explicit-position-cues-describe-conceptual-structure">parallels</a>, not only among concepts, but even between concepts and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-movement-supports-spatial-reasoning">sensorimotor modalities</a>, as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/physical-and-conceptual-spaces-are-coded-in-the-same-region">physical and conceptual space are coded in the same region</a>. The concept of conceptual parallel is itself a metaphor (matching patterns of relation), as is metaphor itself (“carrying over”, like a bridge). At the extreme, Hofstadter, Lakoff, and Johnson argue that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-movement-supports-spatial-reasoning">metaphor based on embodiment is central</a> to child development, abstract reasoning, and everything in between. In their view, cross-domain projection of invariant mental models is key to general intelligence.</p>
