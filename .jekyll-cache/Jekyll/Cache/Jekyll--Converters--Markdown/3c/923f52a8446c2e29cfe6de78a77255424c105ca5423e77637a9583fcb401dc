I"¬<p>The manifold hypothesis connects the apparently <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/the-whole-is-more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts-but-less-than-the-product">complex nature of a high-dimensional space to a simplified low-dimensional manifold</a>. While the manifold hypothesis has been considered in the domain of representations internalized by <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/deep-learning-is-consonant-with-empiricism">neural networks</a>, it could plausibly provide a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/explicit-position-cues-describe-conceptual-structure">conceptual framework</a> for linking the attributes of a system with its emergent properties. Therefore, the manifold hypothesis could be used as a conceptual tool for studying emergence in general, and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/selectively-sampling-dimensions-facilitates-manifold-definition">particularly in neuroscience</a>.</p>
