I"Í<p>If one is using <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/dualscript-is-a-programming-natural-language-for-conversational-interfaces">a complex Dualscript recipe</a> which makes a lot of subsequent calls, then using the recipe a couple dozen times and recording the outputs might enable a more straight-forward recipe based on those examples. In this, Dualscript enables a primitive form of iterated amplification, presumably also with smaller models.</p>
