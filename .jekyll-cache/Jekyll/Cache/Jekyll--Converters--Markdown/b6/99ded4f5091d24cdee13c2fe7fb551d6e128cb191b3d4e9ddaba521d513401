I"œ<p>Many research efforts go into coming up with frameworks for splitting <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cognitive-augmentation-is-morally-unambiguous-when-rehabilitative">cognitive tasks</a> into more <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/language-models-are-few-shot-learners">manageable atomic pieces</a>. But can cognitive tasks be factored this way? Tasks where the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creative-output-can-support-educational-input-in-free-learning">inputs and outputs</a> are discrete and easy to interpret might be composed with others. However, tasks where the inputs and outputs are <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/embeddings-in-machine-learning-represent-prototypes-informed-by-exemplars">abstract representations</a> containing <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/computer-vision-enables-visual-mnemonic-mining">rich information</a> might not be.</p>
