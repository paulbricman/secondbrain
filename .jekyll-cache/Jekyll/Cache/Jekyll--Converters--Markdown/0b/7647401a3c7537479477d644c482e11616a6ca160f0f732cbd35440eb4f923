I"©<p>This metaphor combines aspects of the brain-piano metaphor with aspects of the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-stadiums">brain-stadium metaphor</a>. The brain-orchestra metaphor links neural activity to the symphony produced by an orchestra. Its performance is mostly based on music notes, similar to neural spikes, yet the wide variety of instruments involved highlights the diversity of neuron cells. As in the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-stadiums">brain-stadium metaphor</a>, the brain-orchestra metaphor also provides some intuition for neuroimaging from outside the music hall up to an individual instrument.</p>
