Rather than being a case of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/interpersonal-backlinks-incentivize-collaborative-knowledge-work">two different notes building on each other</a>, the two notes almost perfectly overlap. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/summarization-forces-understanding">summarization forces understanding for both learners</a>, which makes it almost advisable <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/scenius-epitomizes-collective-intelligence">for a community to</a> have multiple notes on the very same concept, written by different individuals. Whatâ€™s more, conceptual gateways can also connect multiple notes of the same learner, which touch on similar ideas from various disciplinary angles, therefore <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/rich-mental-model-repository-is-conductive-of-insight">breaking down conceptual silos</a>.</p>
