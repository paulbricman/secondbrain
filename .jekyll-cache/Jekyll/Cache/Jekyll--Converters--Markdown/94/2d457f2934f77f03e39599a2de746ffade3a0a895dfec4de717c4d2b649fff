I"v<p>Differential equations describe how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/training-and-inference-maintain-and-change-different-values">changes in some functions result in changes in some other functions</a>, recursively. When only considering <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/intricate-functions-whose-inverse-is-trivial-are-easy-to-approximate">functions of one variable</a> (usually time), they’re called ordinary differential equations. When considering functions of multiple variables, and therefore using partial derivatives rather than derivatives, they’re called partial differential equations.</p>
