I"=<p>The tradition of symbolic AI attempted to formalize intelligence as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/logic-frameworks-formalize-truth">symbol manipulation</a>. On the other hand, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">connectionist AI</a> attempted to do that through neural networks, using no explicit symbols. Empiricism, as opposed to nativism, argues that a mind has no prior knowledge about the world prior to observing it, itâ€™s tabula rasa. Deep learning can be viewed as empiricism because models are trained on data from an environment. Deep learning models inherit bias from data, among <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/machine-learning-is-biased">other sources</a>, which has some intriguing implications for the empiricism analogy.</p>
