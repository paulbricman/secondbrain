I"0<p>Just like <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/first-person-projection-is-intuitive-in-programming">digital programming</a> consists of orchestrating electrons, biotic programming consists of orchestrating swarms of microorganisms (e.g. euglena, paramecium). By controlling light sources and projections, a biotic programmer can change the behavior of the organism in computationally useful ways. Similarly, biotic games are based on coordinating microorganisms to achieve certain arbitrary goals. What’s more, biotic server farms make biotic computing accessible, through <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/elderly-scaffold-neural-circuits-to-compensate-for-cognitive-decline">elastic scaling</a>. This biotic representational resource could be contained in a “biotic processing unit.”</p>
