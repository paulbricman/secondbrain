I"£<p>If you canâ€™t actually prove or disprove that another human individual is <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/self-model-of-consciousness-mechanizes-sentience">sentient</a>, then why would it be possible to prove or disprove the sentience of a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-emulation-simply-provides-bodily-redundancy">neural emulation</a>. Specifically, if we take other human individuals as being sentient, why wouldnâ€™t we also consider emulations sentient if they donâ€™t necessarily provide less evidence. In <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spacetime-bounds-life">time</a>, this extends to recognizing the past as real.</p>
