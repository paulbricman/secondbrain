I"õ<p>In his short story titled Axiomatic, Greg Egan introduces the notion of axiomatic implants. Axiomatic implants are speculative devices capable of inoculating the user with certain beliefs. They target beliefs, and have a specific duration of activation. Given that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/beliefs-are-gates-into-the-body-s-biochemistry">beliefs are gates into the bodyâ€™s biochemistry</a>, modulating beliefs through biochemistry and neurophysiology is decently plausible.</p>
