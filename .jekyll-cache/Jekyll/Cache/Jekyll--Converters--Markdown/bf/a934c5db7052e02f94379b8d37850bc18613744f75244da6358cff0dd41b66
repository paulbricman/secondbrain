I"û<p>The integration of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/crowdsourcing-approximates-convex-optimization">crowdsourcing services</a> in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brain-is-like-hardware-mind-is-like-software">software</a> can be streamlined through a â€œHuman API.â€ Essentially, this would consist of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/live-experience-sharing-makes-expertise-accessible">programmatic calls to be relayed to microtasks completed by workers</a>. In a sense, this is similar to the idea of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/live-experience-sharing-makes-expertise-accessible">on-demand expertise sharing</a>, although with entry-level work. This is a pragmatic portrayal of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/safe-deposit-box-portrays-extreme-consciousness-resilience">consciousness scaffolding</a>. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/crowdsourcing-approximates-convex-optimization">Inter-annotator agreement heuristics</a> are crucial.</p>
