      <td>The level of arousal influences functional brain connectivity. This influence leads to changes in the dynamics of thought. A sleepy and drowsy person is considered to have a less rigid, more fluid, and less constrained pattern of thought. Conversely, a stressed fearful person is considered to have a rigid, accurate, convential cognitive dynamic. In the context of the neural manifold hypothesis, this suggests that metabolic influences alter the manifold structure and vector field. Additionally, this means that one can intentionally modify their current neural dynamics using [[Agitation can be weaponized</td>
