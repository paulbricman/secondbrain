I"G<p>Assuming one deeply <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/internalizing-beliefs-incurs-ideological-debt">internalized the belief</a> that the future can be predicted, one’s <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/denying-free-will-is-morally-debilitating">free will becomes trivial to disable</a>. The ability to tap into the future may be supported by a fabricated notion of photons traveling backwards, such as in Egan’s short novel “The Hundred-Light-Year Diary”. Moreover, if the future can be predicted in such an intimate way as through a personal diary, guiding action becomes trivial, especially with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">an ideological scaffolding structure</a> patching out the inconsistencies about spacetime.</p>
