I"‹<p>If one considers <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">neural activity to be based on a vector field attached to a manifold</a> which has <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neuroplasticity-is-like-protein-folding">certain quirks</a>, then one can liken it to airflow. Vector fields drive both changes in neural activity and air displacement.</p>
