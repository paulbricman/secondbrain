I"<p>In machine learning, dark knowledge refers to a trained model’s <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/commonsense-is-a-causal-model-repository">intuition</a> being captured in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/latent-variable-architecture-enables-data-augmentation-through-hidden-state-modulation">expressed uncertainty</a>. It seems that using this expert model intuition as the object of optimization is extremely effective in training a new model on the task. The expert-related error signal provides a rich constraint which forces the new model into internalizing the expert’s intuition, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tacit-knowledge-in-skill-acquisition-is-dark-knowledge-in-machine-learning">just like in tacit knowledge</a>.</p>
