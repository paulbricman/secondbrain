In the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">second brain architecture</a>, this could be done using <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/interpersonal-backlinks-incentivize-collaborative-knowledge-work">graph-theoretic approaches</a>.

For a more low-tech approach, one could simply track word frequency usage <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/historical-lexical-semantics-capture-paradigm-shifts">over time</a> to infer somewhat of a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/version-control-systems-empower-creatives">concept tree</a>, a timeline of sequential concepts used as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/constructivism-fosters-understanding-through-scaffolding">building blocks</a>.</p>
