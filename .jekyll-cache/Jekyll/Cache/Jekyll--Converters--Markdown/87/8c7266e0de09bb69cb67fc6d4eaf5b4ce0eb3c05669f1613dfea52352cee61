I"Î<p>Dynamic attention helps us perceive objects as continuous across time despite their movements. Through indexing and target tracking, it exploits low-level features in order to infuse percepts with coherence, facilitating high-level processing. This is similar to how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/gaze-stabilization-is-preprocessing-in-vision">gaze stabilization</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/pupil-light-response-stabilizes-luminance-on-retina">pupil reflexes</a> reduce stimuli dimensionality early on. Target tracking in dynamic attention is similar to optic flow in computer vision. The limited sampling frequency of dynamic attention allows for the aliasing phenomenon.</p>
