I"ù<p>People tend to unquestioningly identify with a sense of self which they have to continuously protect and foster. In this view, external events, objects, and peers are seen through the lens of alignment with the self. Day-to-day things derive meaning from their relation to one‚Äôs hopes, goals, fears, and so on. However, the sense of a unitary self appears at odds with the sense of transient experience.</p>
