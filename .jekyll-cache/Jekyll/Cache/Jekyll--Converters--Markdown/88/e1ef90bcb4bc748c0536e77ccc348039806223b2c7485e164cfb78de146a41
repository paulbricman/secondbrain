I"ž<p>Itâ€™s difficult for someone to draw a perfect circle without assistance. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-movement-supports-spatial-reasoning">movement supports reasoning</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/drawing-surfaces-extend-visuospatial-sketchpad">drawing surfaces extend working memory</a>, so it would be useful to reduce this friction. In light of this, heuristics or <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/data-driven-modeling-renders-physical-simulation-feasible">data-driven modeling</a> could be used to detect strokes which resemble predefined shapes (e.g. circle, square, car), and autocorrect them.</p>
