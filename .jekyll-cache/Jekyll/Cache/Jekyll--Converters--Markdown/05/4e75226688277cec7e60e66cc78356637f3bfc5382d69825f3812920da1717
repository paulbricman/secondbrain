Consonant with the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/premotor-theory-of-attention-is-fundamentally-enactive">premotor theory of attention</a>, modulating covert premotor attention influences the subsequent saccade trajectory. This saccade curvature can be induced through <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perceptual-load-modulates-distractibility">distractors</a>. This finding is compatible with the model of attention itself as being based on a salience map. Eye movement would seek to navigate towards a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/crowdsourcing-approximates-convex-optimization">salience optimum</a>, while being nudged along the way.</p>
