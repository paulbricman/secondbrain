I"[<p>The grandmother cell hypothesis argues that there are <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/selectively-sampling-dimensions-facilitates-manifold-definition">cortical neurons which selectively code single specific concepts, such as oneâ€™s grandmother</a>. Those <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/emergent-properties-are-dependent-on-low-level-state">gnostic neurons</a> seem to code abstract concepts all by themselves, and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/multi-modal-mappings-generate-multimodal-receptive-fields">respond robustly to variations of that same concept</a>. The grandmother cell hypothesis is a perspective of extreme sparsity, compared to views of more interconnected and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/parallel-distributed-processing-is-resilient-and-efficient">distributed representations</a>.</p>
