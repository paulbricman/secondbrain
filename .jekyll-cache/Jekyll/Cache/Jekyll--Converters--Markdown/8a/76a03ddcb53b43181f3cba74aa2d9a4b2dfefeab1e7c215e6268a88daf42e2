I"&<p>Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is the paradigm of computing devices being <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/phenomenological-transparency-underpins-affordances">seamlessly integrated</a> into miscellaneous objects, buildings, and appliances which enable frictionless interaction with software. Surprisingly, ubicomp can be seen as the opposite of VR: instead of making the technology the focus of attention, ubicomp is about <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/phenomenological-transparency-underpins-affordances">not getting in the way at all</a>. Ubiquitous computing might form the basis of a new <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/world-models-reflect-ideological-structures">perception of the world</a>, one of compute being embedded into the very fabric of reality.</p>
