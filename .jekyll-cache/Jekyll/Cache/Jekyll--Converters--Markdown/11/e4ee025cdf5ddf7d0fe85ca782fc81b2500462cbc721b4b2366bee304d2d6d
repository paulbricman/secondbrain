I"<p>In <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/curse-of-dimensionality-hinders-high-dimensional-mappings">large vector spaces</a>, summing multiple vectors denoting concepts (i.e. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spatial-metaphors-provide-primitives-for-latent-space-navigation">mixing them</a>) can stand for a set containing them. That is because the sum is commutative, just like the set notation. Additionally, the set sum eventually shares features with individual set members across various dimensions.</p>
