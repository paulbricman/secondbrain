I"<p>In machine learning, even if <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">the training objective seems to be minimizing loss</a>, in reality the goal is minimizing the statistically expected loss for future examples, termed risk. This is impossible to quantify given the unknown nature of new data, but can be <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">estimated</a> with the empirical risk, which is strictly based on existing data.</p>
