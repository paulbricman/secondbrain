In essence, this indicates that a mature brain is defined by efficiency and increased signal-to-noise ratio, especially in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/prefrontal-cortex-matures-in-the-mid-twenties">frontal areas</a>. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/elderly-scaffold-neural-circuits-to-compensate-for-cognitive-decline">cognitive decline might reverse the process</a>.</p>
