I"×<p>In the brain-stadium metaphor, neural activity is associated with the vivid activity which happens inside a stadium during a sport event. Each individual supporter from the audience represents a neuron firing. According to this mapping, EEG corresponds to recording sound from outside the stadium, trying to reconstruct individual supporter activity. Additionally, single unit recording corresponds to having microphones down the throats of individual supporters.</p>
