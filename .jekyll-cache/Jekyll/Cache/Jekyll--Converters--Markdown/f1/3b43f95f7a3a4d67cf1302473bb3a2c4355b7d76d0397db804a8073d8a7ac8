I"ò<p>Localization of function consists of the idea that each <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-architecture-guides-cognitive-augmentation">cognitive function</a> is associated with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conscious-awareness-modulates-neural-activity">a certain brain region</a>. In contrast, mass action consists of the idea that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neuroplasticity-enables-cross-modal-compensation">neuroplasticity</a> makes it so that any brain region has the potential to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-buildings">support any cognitive function</a>. Halfway between the two, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/parallel-distributed-processing-is-resilient-and-efficient">PDP</a> argues that cognitive functions are based on distributed networks of specialized regions. Those paradigms are made vivid in the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-cities">brain-city metaphor</a>.</p>
