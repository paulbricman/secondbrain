      <td>Joint probability is the probability of two events occurring at the same time. Marginal probability is the probability of an event occurring regardless of events across other dimensions. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring in the limited bracket of another event occurring. Those provide a framework for probability, just like [[Tense logic formalizes time</td>
