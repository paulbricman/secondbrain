I"±<p>Even if <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tools-for-thought-interface-users-with-knowledge">tools for thought appear to expand human capabilities</a>, little to no attention is given to the possible externalities of using tools for thought in knowledge work. One of the most popular instances of this is the Google effect, which highlights the increased difficulty in committing facts to memory when <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/tools-for-thought-interface-users-with-knowledge">access to search engines is frictionless</a>. Does there appear a sense of dependence on such tools for thought? Are such tools enabling in some ways, but detrimental in others?</p>
