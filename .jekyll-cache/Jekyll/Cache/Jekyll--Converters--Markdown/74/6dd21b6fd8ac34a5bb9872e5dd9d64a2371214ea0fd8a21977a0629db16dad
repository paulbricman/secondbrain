Similar to flow and <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-seeks-homeostasis">stress</a>, there is a sweet-spot of perplexity desired.

Completely unpredictable resources are also not desired, as theyâ€™re not <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/good-learning-is-inherently-pleasurable">pleasant to digest</a>. Resources that are somewhat challenging but not <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/misogi-radically-modifies-affordances">impossible to tackle</a> should be <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/optimizing-for-short-semantic-distances-fosters-learning">aimed for</a>. This would lead to antifragile learning, an attitude of actively patching your weak spots and developing your thinking by systematically challenging yourself.</p>
