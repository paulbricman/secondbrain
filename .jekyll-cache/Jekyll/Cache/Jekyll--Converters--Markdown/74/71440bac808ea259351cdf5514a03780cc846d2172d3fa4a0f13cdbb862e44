      <td>Itâ€™s difficult to accurately compute the trajectory of a rigid object through a fluid. However, with enough examples of various rigid objects moving through the fluid, one can turn the task of physical simulation into a task of data-driven prediction. This has also been applied to [[Modifiers are composable transformations</td>
      <td>texturing in 3D modeling]]. Data-driven modeling makes it possible to conduct [[Automated fabrication supports prosumers</td>
