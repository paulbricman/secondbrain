I"î<p>Discrete items, such as words or <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/logograms-resemble-vector-quantization">logograms</a>, being embedded in a semantic space can be seen as individual checker pieces. The <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">relative arrangement of those items is particularly important</a>, and itâ€™s reflected in the configuration of the checker board containing the individual pieces. This embedding-checkers metaphor provides a tangible way of reasoning about how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">the meaning of items in a latent space is derived mainly through their relative arrangement</a>.</p>
