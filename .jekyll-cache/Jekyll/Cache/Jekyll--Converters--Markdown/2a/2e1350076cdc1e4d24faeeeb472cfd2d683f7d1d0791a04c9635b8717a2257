I"Ž<p>Itâ€™s difficult to accurately compute the trajectory of a rigid object through a fluid. However, with enough examples of various rigid objects moving through the fluid, one can turn the task of physical simulation into a task of data-driven prediction. This has also been applied to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/modifiers-are-composable-transformations">texturing in 3D modeling</a>. Data-driven modeling makes it possible to conduct <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/automated-fabrication-supports-prosumers">automated fabrication</a> which keeps track of physical constraints using only scarce computational resources.</p>
