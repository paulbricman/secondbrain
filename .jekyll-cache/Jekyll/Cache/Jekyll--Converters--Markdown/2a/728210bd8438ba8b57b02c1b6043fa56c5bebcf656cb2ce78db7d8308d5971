I"’<p>In a latent space, related concepts are geometrically close to each other. Whatâ€™s more, [[Metaphor is central to cognition|conceptual parallels]] show up as geometrical parallels. [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region]], which supports this [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|spatial reasoning]]. Based on this [[Semantic embeddings of discrete items are like checkers|spatial metaphor of concepts]], one can use the following [[Phenomenological transparency underpins affordances|primitives]] for navigating the [[Symbols diffuse in latent space|latent space]] in a meaningful way, among others.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Field</strong>: find concepts which are close to a given concept.</li>
  <li><strong>Mix</strong>: find concepts which are close to the center of some given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Span</strong>: find concepts located along the line between two given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift</strong>: determine the directed difference in location between two given concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>Match</strong>: find constellations of concepts which match the shape of a given constellation of concepts.</li>
</ul>
