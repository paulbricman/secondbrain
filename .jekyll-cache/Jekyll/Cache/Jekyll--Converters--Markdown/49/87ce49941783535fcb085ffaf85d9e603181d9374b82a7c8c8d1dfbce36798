I"{<p>If one is tasked with coming up with many <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concepts-are-like-rooms">exemplars</a> of a concept, then they will typically start with the most <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/core-items-are-centroids-in-latent-space">representative ones</a>, and then slowly exhaust their way around the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spatial-metaphors-provide-primitives-for-latent-space-navigation">conceptual periphery</a> of that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/symbols-diffuse-in-latent-space">concept</a>. This progressive increase in difficulty in coming up with exemplars can make <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/contrasting-difficulties-are-like-price-decoys">challenging tasks more accessible</a> (e.g. coming up with many alternative representations in fine arts, reaching back to many old friends).</p>
