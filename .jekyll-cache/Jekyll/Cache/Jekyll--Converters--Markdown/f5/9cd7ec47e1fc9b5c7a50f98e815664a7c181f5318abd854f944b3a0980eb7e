I"Q<p>Similar to how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/historical-lexical-semantics-capture-paradigm-shifts">semantic embeddings can be used to study variations in meaning over time</a>, they can also be used to study variations of meaning <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spacetime-bounds-memeplexes">across space</a>. Essentially, by using <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/unsupervised-learning-derives-semantics-from-non-human-languages">unsupervised learning</a> to derive word meaning from different languages, one can quantify properties of various conceptual structures using <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/spatial-metaphors-provide-primitives-for-latent-space-navigation">latent space navigation</a>. How close are “money” and “happiness” in various cultures? How strong is the “time is money” <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metaphor-is-central-to-cognition">metaphor</a> in different <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/concept-learning-is-few-shot-scaffolding-supported-by-working-memory">conceptual frameworks</a>?</p>
