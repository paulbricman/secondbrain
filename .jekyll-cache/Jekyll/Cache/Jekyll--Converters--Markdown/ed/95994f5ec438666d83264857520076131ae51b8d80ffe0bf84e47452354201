I"5<p>Compared to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feedforward-networks-approximate-functions">arbitrarily wide perceptrons</a> which describe a one-step transformation, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/deep-learning-is-consonant-with-empiricism">deep learning</a> often describes a series of simpler transformations which can are chained together. This makes deep learning practical, even if <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/feedforward-networks-approximate-functions">one-layer perceptrons could always do the job in theory</a>.</p>
