I"õ<p>The <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/working-memory-recruits-sensory-areas-for-housing-representations">prefrontal cortex</a> is one of the last <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-are-like-cities">brain regions</a> to fully mature, reaching its structural peak in the mid twenties. Given its <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cortical-subcortical-conflict-generates-limbic-friction">crucial role in mediating limbic friction</a>, itâ€™s not surprising that teens are somewhat more impulsive and driven by the short-term. The mechanism for reducing time-discounting is simply not fully mature. Whatâ€™s more, this might also explain why <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/demographic-mark-up-of-authorship-reflects-cognitive-profile-of-domain">transformative breakthroughs in many fields are made by young scholars</a> (e.g. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-substrate-of-social-interaction-enables-neurophysiological-turing-test">Turing</a>).</p>
