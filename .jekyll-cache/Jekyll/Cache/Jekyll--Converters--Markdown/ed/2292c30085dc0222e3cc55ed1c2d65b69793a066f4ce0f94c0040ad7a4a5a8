      <td>Cognitivism is considered to lead to two counterintuitive consequences in the experiential domain. First, it postulates that there are mechanisms of the mind which are inaccessible to conscious awareness. Not only are they said to be unconscious, but they’re said to be impossible to bring into conscious awareness. Second, cognitivism postulates that the mind consists of fragmented modules, operating one with each other. In doing this, it challenges the experiential conviction of the unity of the self, and builds up a picture of the fragmented self. [[Beliefs are gates into the body’s biochemistry</td>
      <td>Those postulates of cognitivism could plausibly have experiential consequences for the researchers who internalize them.]]</td>
