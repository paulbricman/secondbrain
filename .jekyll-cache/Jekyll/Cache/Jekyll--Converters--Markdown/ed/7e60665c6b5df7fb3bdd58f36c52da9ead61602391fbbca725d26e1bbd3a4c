I"å<p>Due to the fact that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">supervised learning assumes an underlying mapping combined with noise</a>, a larger <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/rule-based-data-synthesis-renders-reverse-mapping-feasible">dataset</a> provides a clearer picture of the underlying function, as the noise components cancel out. In contrast, a smaller dataset doesnâ€™t provide the opportunity for the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/supervised-learning-assumes-underlying-structure">supervised model</a> to properly pick out the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brains-mature-through-pruning">underlying function from the noise</a>.</p>
