I"Ï<p>Before deriving an <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/world-models-reflect-ideological-structures">accurate model</a> of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neuroplasticity-is-like-protein-folding">how the brain works</a>, we might be able to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-emulations-are-considered-safe-when-below-natural-error-rate">engineer neural emulations</a> by simply framing the task as a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/forecasting-forces-predictive-world-models-to-internalize-meaningful-representations">neural activity forecasting problem</a>. This reliably moves <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-emulation-simply-provides-bodily-redundancy">neural emulation</a> in the â€œThinking Humanlyâ€ quadrant, because the objective function essentially becomes <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-emulations-are-considered-safe-when-below-natural-error-rate">â€œthink as similar to humans as possibleâ€</a>, through <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-manifold-folding-explains-explanatory-drive">neural activity as a proxy</a>. However, the initial condition might also be crucial, besides getting the dynamics right.</p>
