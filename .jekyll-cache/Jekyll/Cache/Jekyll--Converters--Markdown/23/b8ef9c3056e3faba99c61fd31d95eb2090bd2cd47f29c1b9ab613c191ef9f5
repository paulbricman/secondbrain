I"#<p>There are large text corpora available from various moments in history, especially since the middle of the 20th century. By using an <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/unsupervised-learning-derives-semantics-from-non-human-languages">unsupervised approach</a> for deriving word meanings, one can investigate how word meanings change over time, with respect to each other. This is the main interest in historical lexical semantics. What <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metaphor-is-central-to-cognition">metaphors</a> did post-war France use to make sense of the world? What <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metaphor-is-central-to-cognition">metaphors</a> did post-soviet Eastern Europe use to see the world? By keyframing meanings across time, one might observe that meaning dynamics can be approximated with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/boids-approximate-crowd-kinetics">a trivial model</a>, albeit in <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">high-dimensional space</a>.</p>
