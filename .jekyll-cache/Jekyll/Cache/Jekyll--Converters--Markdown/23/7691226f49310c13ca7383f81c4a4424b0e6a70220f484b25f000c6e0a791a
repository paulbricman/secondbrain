      <td>The semantic network model is a wide-spread view on the functional structure of long-term memory in cognitive psychology. It consists of a network of pieces of information which are connected through semantic links. Whatâ€™s more, retrieval time appears to correlate with graph traversal distance. In the context of the [[Second brain has a cognitive architecture</td>
