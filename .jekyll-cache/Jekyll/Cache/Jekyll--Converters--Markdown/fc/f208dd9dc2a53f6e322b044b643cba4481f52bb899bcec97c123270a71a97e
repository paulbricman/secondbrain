I"2<p>In a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/continuous-state-dynamical-systems-share-a-common-structure">dynamical systems</a>, attractors are states surrounded by a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memeplexes-resemble-grativational-attractors">basin</a> which nudges all <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/phenomenal-space-is-adaptive">trajectories</a> towards them. In contrast, repellors are states surrounded by a basin which diverts all trajectories away from them. Generally, attractors are stable, while repellors are not.</p>
