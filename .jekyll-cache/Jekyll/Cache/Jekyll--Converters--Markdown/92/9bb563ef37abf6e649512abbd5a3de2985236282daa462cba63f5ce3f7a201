I"³<p>Both <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/neural-networks-are-a-massive-conceptual-gateway">artificial and biological neurons</a> appear to develop receptive fields which <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/multi-modal-representations-foster-understanding">span multiple modalities</a> if initially exposed to multi-modal data. In such contexts, it doesnâ€™t seem like neurons specialize in responding to individual modalities, likely due to the mutually-informing dimensions of the data itself. This further suggests that cognitive processes are not conducted in isolation, but in a deep interconnected fashion from which an abstract conceptual understanding emerges.</p>
