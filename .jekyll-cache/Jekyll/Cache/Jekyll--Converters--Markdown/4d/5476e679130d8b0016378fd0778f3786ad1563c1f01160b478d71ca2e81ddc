I"ÿ<p>Not only is most of machine learning <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/machine-learning-is-interpolative">interpolative</a> and therefore limited in generalization, but it is often not well suited for manipulating <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/finite-state-dynamical-systems-are-diverse">discrete structures</a>. Just like a Fourier series approximates a square signal with glitches caused (i.e. Gibbs phenomenon), <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/deep-learning-is-consonant-with-empiricism">neural networks</a> are brittle when <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mental-representations-connect-internal-with-external-state">representing</a> discrete discontinuous structures. However, one could argue that the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">brain</a> supports a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/phenomenal-space-is-adaptive">continuous mental and phenomenal space</a>, which sometimes approximates discrete systems.</p>
