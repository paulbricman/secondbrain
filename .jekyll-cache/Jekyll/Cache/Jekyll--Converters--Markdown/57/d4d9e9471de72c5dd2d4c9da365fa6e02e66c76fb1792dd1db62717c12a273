I"È<p>In Cartesian and cognitive realism, the ideal of the mind is to be a mirror of nature. This coherence between the subject and the object would presumably lead to one being â€œin touch with realityâ€. However, the apparent lack of direct access to the â€œouter worldâ€ leaves one only with their internal representations, as expressed in idealism. The actual ideal of mind as a mirror of nature leads to what can be described as Cartesian anxiety.</p>
