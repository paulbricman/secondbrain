I"_<p>Some cities were designed by prescribing certain social functions to certain neighborhoods. In contrast, other cities developed spontaneously, without focusing on localization of function, eventually developing a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/parallel-distributed-processing-is-resilient-and-efficient">distributed network</a> of neighborhoods. Similarly, the brain-city metaphor highlights how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/is-cognitive-function-localized-or-distributed-in-brain-structure">various neuroscientific perspectives use different cognitive architectures</a>.</p>
