Remapping consists of changing object location representation based on changed eye attending location. In the intervening saccade task, the monkey has to move her eyes while keeping track of the target location. Neurons whose <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/multi-modal-mappings-generate-multimodal-receptive-fields">receptive fields</a> cover the target after the intervening sacade start firing for remapping. By probing neurons involved in movement intention we can <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/forecasting-forces-predictive-world-models-to-internalize-meaningful-representations">predict future movements</a> before they occur and use this in building brain-computer interfaces.</p>
