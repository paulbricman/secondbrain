I"ë<p>In experimental psychology, guidelines for focusing on responding quickly usually result in lower accuracy. Conversely, guidelines for focusing on high accuracy usually result in increased response times. There is a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/experience-sampling-faces-an-accuracy-attrition-trade-off">trade-off</a> between speed and accuracy when <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/rotating-interventions-accelerate-behavior-change">working with behavior</a>. In light of this, mechanisms which automatically increase accuracy (e.g. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/shape-autocorrect-facilitates-diagram-creation-through-gesturing">autocorrect</a>) allow the user to be sloppier, and therefore faster.</p>
