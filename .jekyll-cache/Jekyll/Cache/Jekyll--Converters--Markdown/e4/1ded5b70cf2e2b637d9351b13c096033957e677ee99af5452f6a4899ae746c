I"T<p>If one is wrapping a <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conversational-interfaces-render-knowledge-bases-into-agents">conversational interface around their knowledge base</a>, but they also store highly sensitive information in there, then how can they selectively share the non-sensitive <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/creative-output-can-support-educational-input-in-free-learning">creative output</a>? A low-tech approach would be to use keywords for restricting outputs. Additionally, semantic distance to such keywords could be used as an indicator of sensitivity. However, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/natural-language-inference-derives-conceptual-structure">natural language inference</a> can be used to evaluate whether a given response contains sensitive information, similar to descriptive search.</p>
