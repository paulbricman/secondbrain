I"5<p>The binding problem can be subdivided into several subproblems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Feature binding: How are features of stimuli combined into coherent representations of objects? Perhaps through biased receptive fields.</li>
  <li>

          <td>Subjective unity]] of perception: How are percepts integrated into a coherent experience? Perhaps through short-term feature memory.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Variable binding: How are roles associated with entities? Perhaps through firing synchrony. Nengo models this as convolutions between semantic pointers.</li>
  <li>General coordination: How are abstract latent representations combined coherently with current relevance?</li>
</ol>
