I"5<p>Barbara Tversky argues that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/body-movement-supports-spatial-reasoning">spatial reasoning</a> and the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/semantic-embeddings-of-discrete-items-are-like-checkers">relative representations of physical objects in physical space</a> is the foundation of conceptual thought. But, if the physical space is coded in three dimensions, how can it provide the richness and expressivity for housing concepts? Word embeddings typically span hundreds of dimensions. Perhaps <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-and-motor-action-distort-spatial-representation">the non-linear distortions associated with perception and motor action are used as high-dimensional building blocks</a> in the constrained space of three dimensions.</p>
