During sleep, the body operates on a different metabolism compared to waking. Therefore, neural dynamics are different during sleep. Dreaming may be an evolutionary response to this <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/agitation-can-be-weaponized">opportunity of harnessing otherwise unavailable neural dynamics</a> in problem solving and decision making. Whatâ€™s more, dream recall difficulty can be explained by <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/similar-embodiment-predicts-manifold-alignment">neural manifold misalignment</a> between sleep and waking brain states, similar to how <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/how-can-routine-cell-replacement-permit-psychological-continuity">remembering old memories is difficult</a>. Wake-back-to-bed technique reduces metabolic contrast and fosters recall. Therefore, dream recall should be done early in the morning, while <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/metabolism-influences-neural-dynamics">metabolic changes are still underway</a>. Additionally, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/how-can-routine-cell-replacement-permit-psychological-continuity">continuous cross-referencing</a> between representations should enable <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/conceptual-gateways-are-like-wormholes">successful transfer to waking</a>.</p>
