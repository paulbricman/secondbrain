I"É<p>Based on load, the brain predictibly <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/elderly-scaffold-neural-circuits-to-compensate-for-cognitive-decline">recruits otherwise unrelated regions in certain cognitive tasks, a phenomenon also known as compensatory scaffolding</a>. When processing load resumes to manageable levels, the spontaneous increase of allocated resources reverts. This resembles variable allocation of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brain-is-like-hardware-mind-is-like-software">computational resources</a> in web apps with unpredictible user traffic, such as in cloud services. However, just like for a string, thereâ€™s still a strong upper limit approached asymptotically.</p>
