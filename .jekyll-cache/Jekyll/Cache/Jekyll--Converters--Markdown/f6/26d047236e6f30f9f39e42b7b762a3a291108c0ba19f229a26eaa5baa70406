      <td>Boids model crowd movement. Individual agents are guided through a linear combination of [[Technical indicators are heuristics for stock market forecasting</td>

      <td>avoid crowded neighborhoods]]), [[Alignment is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive</td>
      <td>alignment]] (align with nearby agents), and cohesion (aim for the [[Core items are centroids in latent space</td>
