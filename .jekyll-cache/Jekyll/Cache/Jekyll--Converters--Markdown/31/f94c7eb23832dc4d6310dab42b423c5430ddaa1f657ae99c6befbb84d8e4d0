I" <p>Family resemblance is the set of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/particle-systems-populate-spaces-with-object-instances">implicit dimensions</a> which glue together the members of a representational family. Family resemblance stitches together <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/symbols-diffuse-in-latent-space">fuzzy borders of fuzzy concepts</a>. It creates gradients of membership in the latent space with <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/logic-frameworks-formalize-truth">continuous truth values</a>. Originally applied to what brings together members of a family, family resemblance can elegantly extend beyond facial features.</p>
