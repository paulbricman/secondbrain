I"d<p>The debate between <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/cognitive-realism-versus-idealism">realism and idealism</a> in the context of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/representationism-in-cognition-is-adaptationism-in-evolution">representations</a> can seen as a chicken-egg problem. Who came first, the world or the image? Realism argues that the world informs representations, while idealism argues that representations inform our world. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/darwinism-infuses-enaction-with-realism">Enaction</a> attempts to solve the world-image problem by arguing that the two are mutually-informing. Enaction argues that cognition is an emergent property of a tight sensorimotor loop which links <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">perception</a> with action. At the extreme, enaction suggests that perception is as much guided by action as premotor intentions as is action guided by perception. <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/phenomenological-transparency-underpins-affordances">Naive realism is to be expected</a>.</p>
