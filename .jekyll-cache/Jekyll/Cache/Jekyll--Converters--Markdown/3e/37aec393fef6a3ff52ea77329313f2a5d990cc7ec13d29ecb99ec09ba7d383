I"ì<p>The brain-building metaphor is focused on the distinction between structure and function. According to this metaphor, brain structure corresponds to the building structure. Additionally, in a similar way a building structure supports various social functions (e.g. work, leisure, etc.), the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/brain-is-like-hardware-mind-is-like-software">brain structure supports various cognitive functions</a> (e.g. hope, act, etc.). On a related note, it is the architecture which connects the structure and the function, both for the building and the brain. This idea gave rise to the notion of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">cognitive architectures</a>.</p>
