I"Ú<p>It has been observed that <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/adaptive-physiology-reflects-cognitive-processes">high-level cognition modulates</a> pupil size. Particularly fascinating is the way in which visual imagery influences pupil size. Visualizing a (relatively) bright object or scene appears to actually lead to a physiological response in the eye, where the pupils constrict. Similarly, visualizing a dark scene nudges the pupils into dilating more.</p>
