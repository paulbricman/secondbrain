I"ï<p>Both artificial and biological neurons appear to develop receptive fields which span multiple modalities if initially exposed to multi-modal data. In such contexts, it doesnâ€™t seem like neurons specialize in responding to individual modalities, likely due to the mutually-informing dimensions of the data itself. This further suggests that cognitive processes are not conducted in isolation, but in a deep interconnected fashion from which an abstract conceptual understanding emerges.</p>
