I"‘<p>Besides being <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mental-representations-connect-internal-with-external-state">mental representations</a>, and more broadly <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/mental-simulations-are-mental-representations-of-possible-worlds">mental simulations</a>, phenomenal (re)presentations are constrained by stimulus-correlation as a bottom-up influence. The virtual simulated world has to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/minds-are-like-mirrors-of-nature">closely reflect relevant aspects of reality</a>. Additionally, phenomenal (re)presentations are also contrained by <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">top-down influences</a> such as <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/biological-reward-systems-are-malleable">expectation</a>. In this sense, waking states can be seen as stimulus-correlated dreaming.</p>
