In doing this, they increase the diversity of the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/memeplexes-resemble-grativational-attractors">meme pool</a> and the selective pressure which <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/meme-age-signals-relevance">memes are subjected to</a>, resulting in ever more powerful ideas. What’s more, they enable the recycling of mental models so that each discipline isn’t tasked with coming up with analogous ones on its own. In light of this, conceptual gateway engineering might be a fruitful approach to accelerating scientific inquiry through second-order effects.
