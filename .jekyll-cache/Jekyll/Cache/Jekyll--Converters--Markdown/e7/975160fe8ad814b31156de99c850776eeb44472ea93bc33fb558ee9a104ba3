I"Ô<p>Assuming cognition is the result of a tight sensorimotor loop between the percepts and actions of an individual, evolution suggests that the loop still provides an optimal grip on the world through adaptation to ecology. In this way, Darwinism casts enaction in a light of sophisticated realism. However, enaction responds that the plethora of observed adaptations (e.g. various numbers of photoreceptor types), indicates a disconnect between world and images.</p>
