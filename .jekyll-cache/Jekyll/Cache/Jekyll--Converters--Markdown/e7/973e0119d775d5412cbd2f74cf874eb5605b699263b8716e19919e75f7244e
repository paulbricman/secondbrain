I"P<p>When considering a space with an extremely high number of dimensions, it might suffice to selectively sample from a subset of dimensions for <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/manifolds-formalize-emergence">defining an expressive manifold</a>. The resulting dimensionality of the manifold be lower than the one of selective sampling. An instance of this might render neural interfaces feasible, where reading from a subset of critical neurons might bring advanced imaging into our technological reach, as argued by Greg Egan in his short story titled “Learning To Be Me”.</p>
