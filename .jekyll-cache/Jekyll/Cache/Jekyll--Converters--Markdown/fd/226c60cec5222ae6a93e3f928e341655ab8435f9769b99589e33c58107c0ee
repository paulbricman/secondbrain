I",<p>The semantic network model is a wide-spread view on the functional structure of long-term memory in cognitive psychology. It consists of a network of pieces of information which are connected through semantic links. What’s more, retrieval time appears to correlate with graph traversal distance. In the context of the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">second brain architecture</a>, the non-linear structure of interconnected notes resembles such a semantic network view of long-term memory. This parallel is similar to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-buffer-is-like-short-term-memory">the short-term memory one</a> and the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/fluid-search-output-resembles-working-memory">working memory one</a>. Over time, <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/second-brain-has-a-cognitive-architecture">the second brain</a> reflects one’s long-term memory better and better, due to a marked increase in the overlap following patient note-taking.</p>
