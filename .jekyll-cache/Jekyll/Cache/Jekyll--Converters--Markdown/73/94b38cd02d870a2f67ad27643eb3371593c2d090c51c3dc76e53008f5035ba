I"p<p>Concept learning might be described as the process of <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/constructivism-fosters-understanding-through-scaffolding">constructively scaffolding</a> a relative conceptual structure. Initially, related concepts are elevated in working memory, similar to <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/fluid-search-enables-scaffolding-structure-for-incremental-reading">fluid search output</a>. Then, the novel concept is sustained in a stasis, while the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/perception-is-context-dependent">relations to the previous concepts</a> are set in place. After a short while, structural changes start to reflect the internalization of the new concept, which is likely already located in the <a class="internal-link" href="/secondbrain/similar-embodiment-predicts-manifold-alignment">same neural space</a>.</p>
