Cognitive realism argues that a large part of cognition is about forming and manipulating coherent representations of the "outside" world in an attempt to best navigate it. Conversely, idealism argues that it is only our representations that we have access to, so they must be our only reference points. In the extreme, idealism holds that even the notion of an "outside" world is an internal representation.
