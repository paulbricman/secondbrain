Assuming one deeply internalized the belief that the future can be predicted, one's free will becomes trivial to disable. The ability to tap into the future may be supported by a fabricated notion such as the detection of glimpses into the next collapse of the universe, such as in Egan's short novel "The Hundred-Light-Year Diary". Moreover, if the future can be predicted in such an intimate way as through a personal diary, guiding action becomes trivial, especially with an ideological scaffolding structure patching out the inconsistencies about spacetime.
