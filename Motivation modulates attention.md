A prospective reward associated with a stimuli can boost the detection sensitivity of a person to that stimuli. This can be observed by artificially associating a class of stimuli with a reward and monitoring the deployment of attention to different stimuli. This deployment of spatial attention can even be observed in ERP differences beetween the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres of the rewarded stimuli. Additionally, in the cued reward Stroop paradigm, reward expectation is manipulated before a Stroop interference task. However, with a substraction, neural activity related to reward expectation (CNV) can be extracted.
