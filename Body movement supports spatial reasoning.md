Participants consistently make hand gestures when tasked with memorizing a spatial configuration. Artificially supressing hand gesturing leads to a decrease in performance. Those body movements performed during reasoning accurately reflect the representations being manipulated, especially their relative configuration. Surprisingly, blind people also gesture. This implies that body movement can be used and trained for supporting abstract reasoning.
