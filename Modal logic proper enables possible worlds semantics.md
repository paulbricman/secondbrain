In modal logics, the meaning of a sentence does not only depend on the current situation. Modal operators are like the universal and existential quantifiers. Modal logic proper, tense logic, deontic logic, provability logic, and epistemic logic are all examples of modal logic. Modal logic proper introduces two modal operators: necessity and possibility. The box stands for necessity, and the diamond stands for possibility. Leibniz defined possible worlds as ways the world could be. Kripke's key idea was to introduce relative possibility (the possibility relative to a possible world) through the accessibility relation. Propositional atoms have different values in different worlds. Informally, the accessibility relation determines whether a world is possible relative to a different world. In modal logic proper, the valuation function requires not only a formula but also the world. A Kripke model consists of a triple <W, R, v>. Inductive truth definitions are very similar for modal logic proper compared to propositional logic if you only consider one world. A formula is possible in a world if and only if there is another world accessible from it where the formula is true. A formula is necessary in a world if and only if it's true in all accessible worlds. Validity requires designated values for all models and all their worlds at once.
