Contrary to what [[Representationism in cognition is adaptationism in evolution|adaptationism would predict]], evolution is not a gradual change of traits in an optimization process, but is punctuated with sudden discontinuities. This is consonant with [[Pleiotropy challenges adaptationism|pleiotropy]], in that it highlights the internal constraints of an organism guiding its own evolutionary trajectory. It's not trivial to move out of local optima in evolution, and it requires a coordinated and unlikely choreography of changes across multiple domains. However, those unlikely shifts correspond to the observed discontinuities in evolution.
