The brain-piano metaphor highlights the nature of spiking neurons. By mapping an individual neuron to an individual key on the piano, one can then think of aggregate neural activity as a song played on the piano. Each key press corresponds to the spike of a specific neuron. Additionally, there's some rhythmicity to both the brain and the piano. Rhythmicity shows up in the brain as periodic waves and on the piano as rhythm signatures.
