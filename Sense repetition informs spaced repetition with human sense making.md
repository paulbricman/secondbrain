The traditional spaced repetition paradigm treats items or flashcards as independent units which have to be approached and learned individually. However, the human mind arguably contains no clear-cut distinctions between such items and deeply integrates them in an interconnected web of knowledge. Therefore, spaced repetition systems could integrate notions of semantic relatedness between the items being learned, leading to a new paradigm of sense repetition.
