Developing meaningful behaviors based on external rewards alone, as opposed to a self-regulating reward mechanism, is not sustainable. Take away the external reward, be it gold stars or social appraisal, and the behavior unsurisingly stops being rewarding, even more so due to the sharp decline in perceived reward. Learning to modulate the internal reward system is counterintuitively rational in this regard.
