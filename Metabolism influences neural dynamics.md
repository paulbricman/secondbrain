The level of arousal influences functional brain connectivity. This influence leads to changes in the dynamics of thought. A sleepy and drowsy person is considered to have a less rigid, more fluid, and less constrained pattern of thought. Conversely, a stressed fearful person is considered to have a rigid, accurate, convential cognitive dynamic. In the context of the neural manifold hypothesis, this suggests that metabolic influences alter the manifold structure and vector field.
