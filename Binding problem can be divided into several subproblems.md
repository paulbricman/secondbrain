The binding problem can be subdivided into several subproblems:
1. Feature binding: How are features of stimuli combined into coherent representations of objects? Perhaps through biased receptive fields.
2. [[Experiential consequences of cognitivism|Subjective unity]] of perception: How are percepts integrated into a coherent experience? Perhaps through short-term feature memory.
3. Variable binding: How are roles associated with entities? Perhaps through firing synchrony. Nengo models this as convolutions between semantic pointers.
4. General coordination: How are abstract latent representations combined coherently with current relevance?
