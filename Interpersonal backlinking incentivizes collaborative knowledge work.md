Backlinks are incoming connections from other nodes to the current node being made visible. Besides highlighting associations between notes in non-linear not-taking, backlinks could provide a means of collaborative knowledge work. By presenting interpersonal backlinks (backlinks caused by a person linking one of their notes to a note from a different person), one can encourage a dense network of collective knowledge. By introducing a node ranking method, such as PageRank, one could incentivize knowledge workers to produce the valuable content.
