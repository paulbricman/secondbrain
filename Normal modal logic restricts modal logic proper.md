Several variations can be derived from modal logic proper by enforcing additional constraints. The reflexive restriction enforces reflexive relationship for all possible worlds. The symmetry restriction enforces reciprocal or mutual relations between worlds. The transitivity restriction is self-explanatory. The extendability restriction means that there's always some world you can go to, there are no dead end worlds. Validity in restricted normal modal logics are obtained by taking into consideration the specific dynamics of truth preservation. In the tableaux, the restrictions intuitively apply as inferences on the relations themselves.
