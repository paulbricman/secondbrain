In his short story titled "Safe-deposit Box", Greg Egan portrays an individual undergoing a progressive decay of brain tissue. The story describes how his consciousness, in a resourceful attempt to persist, manages to unconsciously negotiate time spent in the bodies of other individuals. The "Safe-deposit Box" depicts an extreme case of phychological resilience through an individual whose consciousness jumps regularly from individual to individual around his body.
