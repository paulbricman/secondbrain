Tense logic is a modal logic with four modal operators related to past and future. However, the modal operators of tense logic are perfectly defined in terms of accessibility relations. Time flow direction is based on which world accesses which other world. In tense logic, the accessibility relation stands for "earlier than", meaning that only past worlds can access future worlds.
