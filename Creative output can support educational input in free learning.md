Free learning communities are based on validation through creation. Individuals are forced to generate creative output in order to obtain credibility, validation, and financial support. However, creative output which is educational in nature can be piped back into the free learning community as educational content, essentially closing the loop. There is great value in distilling material and creating great educational resources, and an appropriate culture around this might render free learning communities self-sustainable.
