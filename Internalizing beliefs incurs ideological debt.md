Assuming one's ideological mark-up can be viewed as a finite collection of interconnected beliefs, it is possible to make a parallel between the internalization of beliefs and the idea of debt. When internalizing a belief, one is "buying into it" based on coherence with prior beliefs. However, by "buying into" a plethora of mutually-compatible beliefs in a craving for explanatory power, one is essentially getting into debt. The ideological debt parallel highlights the fact that a mutually-reinforced belief structure is especially rigid and inflexible to perturbations. Accumulating ideological debt hurdles the explorative dimension of memetic foraging. This mindset narrowing appears related to [[Metabolism influences neural dynamics|rigidity induced by arousal]].
