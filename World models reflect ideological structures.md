The statements people make about an absolute and objective reality reflect their inner beliefs as much as they reflect empirical observations. This is caused by the top-down lens through which people perceive the world, and its inevitable anthropocentric influence. If all you have is a computational paradigm, everything you see looks like an information-processing machine. However, if everything you see looks like an information-processing machine, you might have internalized a belief about the generality of computation. This connection can provide a way of tapping into inner belief structures in some forms of psychotherapy.
