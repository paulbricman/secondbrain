The development of commonsense can be viewed as the creation and polishing of causal models about the world. Causal models enable an intuitive understanding of many different domains of one's life. For instance, intuitive physics provides us with basic understanding about physical objects, movement, forces, and so on. Intuitive sociology gives us a basic sense of groups, families, collectives, us and them. Intuitive morality gives us a basic understanding of good and bad, likely formed through associations with physical experience, namely pain and pleasure.
