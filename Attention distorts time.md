Traditionally, cognitive magnification refers to more brain tissue being allocated to the processing of important aspects of stimuli. However, this magnification can also take place across time. Through a change in the attentional "sampling rate", dynamic attention can induce distortions of subjective time as more information is being processed. Attention-induced time distortions are conceptually similar to periods of overclocking on a CPU.
