Physical and conceptual space are coded in the same region 
hippocampus and grid cells are checkers
Hand gestures foster cognitive map, foster spatial retention
Gestures reflect model interacted with
Gestures are an expression of thought
Spatio-motor movement could store a fleeting representation during thought
Spatial reasoning is the confluence of all senses
Action and perception distord space representation
Motor cortex magnifies by function, not structure (also children drawings)
If physical space informs conceptual space, how does it all fit in 3 dimensions? distortion?
