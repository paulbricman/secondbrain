prosumers provide an alternative to consumerism, makers form prosumerism
automated fabrication supports citizen engineers, makers, prosumers
real physics constraints from simulation can inform object design
data-driven physical simulation makes design with contraints computationally feasible 
Single-slider provides richer user latent space exploration than pairwise comparison, together with maximum information questions (SSM, 2GC)
crowdsourcing approximates convex optimization, through subtasks
