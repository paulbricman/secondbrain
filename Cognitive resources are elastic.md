Based on load, the brain predictibly recruits otherwise unrelated regions in certain cognitive tasks, a phenomenon also known as compensatory scaffolding. When processing load resumes to manageable levels, the spontaneous increase of allocated resources reverts. This resembles variable allocation of computational resources in web apps with unpredictible user traffic, such as in cloud services. However, just like for a string, there's still a strong upper limit approached asymptotically.
