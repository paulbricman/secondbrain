In guided search, people are said to make use of pre-attentive low-level features in their search for a more complex item. Essentially, guidance based on a somewhat parallel pre-attentive search provides a preliminary filtering mechanism. Similarly, in semantic search and other machine learning tasks, progressively more complex models are employed to sequentially tread through the items involved.
