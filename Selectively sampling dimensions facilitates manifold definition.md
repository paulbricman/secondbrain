When considering a space with an extremely high number of dimensions, it might suffice to selectively sample from a subset of dimensions for defining an expressive manifold. The resulting dimensionality of the manifold wouldn't match the one caused by selective sampling, but it would be even lower. An instance of this might be feasible in neural interfaces, where reading from a subset of critical neurons might bring advanced imaging into our technological reach, as argued by Greg Egan in his short story titled "Learning To Be Me".
