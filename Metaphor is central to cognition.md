Metaphor can be seen as something much more central to thought than a colorful figure of speech in literature. Metaphorical thought helps us find [[Explicit position cues accelerate concept learning|parallels]], not only among concepts, but even between concepts and [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|sensorimotor modalities]], as [[Physical and conceptual spaces are coded in the same region|physical and conceptual space are coded in the same region]]. The concept of conceptual parallel is itself a metaphor (matching patterns of relation), as is metaphor itself ("carrying over", like a bridge). At the extreme, Hofstadter, Lakoff, and Johnson argue that [[Body movement supports spatial reasoning|metaphor based on embodiment is central]] to child development, abstract reasoning, and everything in between. In their view, cross-domain projection of invariant mental models is key to general intelligence.
