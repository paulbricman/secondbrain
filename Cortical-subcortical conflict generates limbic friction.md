Limbic friction is a concept introduced by Andrew Huberman which refers to the routine conflict between low-level instinctive drives manifested in subcortical areas and high-level reflexive drives manifested in the neocortex. Even though this notion unquestioningly subscribes to the anatomical dichotomy of cortical/subcortical being superimposed on cognitive function, it successfully highlights the demanding conflict between goals at those different levels. Moreover, it seems like systematically rewarding top-down effort helps develop endurance to limbic friction.
