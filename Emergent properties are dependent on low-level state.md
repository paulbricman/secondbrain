Emergent properties of a system can often be seen as approximate macrolevel descriptions of the low level. In this view, emerging symbolic representations in a neural network would be closely linked to the resonant dynamics of the network itself. In inclusive emergence, symbolic representations derived from distributed neural activity can't be properly tackled independently, contrary to what has been tried with syntax trees, for instance. A good parallel for inclusive emergence in cognition is genetic coding. In genetic coding, DNA structures do code for specific aminoacids, but only in the context of a complex distributed metabolic system which resides in the background of such symbols.
