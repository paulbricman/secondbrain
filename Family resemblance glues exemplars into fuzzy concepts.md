Family resemblance is the set of implicit dimensions which glue together the members of a representational family. Family resemblance stitches together fuzzy borders of fuzzy concepts. It creates gradients of membership in the latent space with continuous truth values. Originally applied to what brings together members of a family, family resemblance can elegantly extend beyond facial features.
