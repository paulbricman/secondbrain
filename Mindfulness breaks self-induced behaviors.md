Mindfulness meditation can be seen as the exercise of recognizing intentions and desires which are derived from one's belief in the existence of the self. Buddhist practitioners argue that it is only by breaking the automatic chain of reaction which originates from the belief of self that one can become wise and free. This perspective is encoded in the Buddhist Wheel of Life, or samsara, which represents a continuous cycle which goes repeatedly from self to intention across a complex trajectory.
