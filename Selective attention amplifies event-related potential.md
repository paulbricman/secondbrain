One mechanism through which selective attention is suggested to facilitate perception is signal enhancement. In signal enhancement, attention presumably amplifies the intensity of relevant stimuli, making them appear more bright or loud. Besides subjective reporting, signal enhancement induced by selective attention can be observed in event-related potentials varying in amplitude.
