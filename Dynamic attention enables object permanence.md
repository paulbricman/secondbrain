We need to keep track of the objects around us. Dynamic attention helps us perceive objects as continuous across time despite their movements. The first function of dynamic attention is indexing, which consists of noting the existence of discrete objects. The second function of dynamic attention is target tracking, which consists of keeping track of a target during movement. Target tracking in dynamic attention is similar to optic flow in computer vision. An important characteristic of dynamic attention is temporal resolution. Temporal resolution dictates how fine-grained target tracking can be performed. The limited sampling frequency of dynamic attention allows for the aliasing phenomenon.
