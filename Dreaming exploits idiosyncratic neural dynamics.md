Metabolism influences neural dynamics. During sleep, the body operates on an arguably different metabolism compared to waking. Therefore, neural dynamics are different during sleep. Dreaming may be an evolutionary response to this opportunity of harnessing otherwise unavailable neural dynamics in problem solving and decision making.
