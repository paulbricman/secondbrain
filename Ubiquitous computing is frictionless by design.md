Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is the paradigm of computing devices being seamlessly integrated into miscellaneous objects, buildings, and appliances which enable frictionless interaction with software. Surprisingly, ubicomp can be seen as the opposite of VR: instead of making the technology the focus of attention, ubicomp is about not getting in the way at all. Ubiquitous computing might form the basis of a new perception of the world, one of compute being embedded into the very fabric of reality.
