Sociologists agree on the fact that public opinion is formed in time, not instantly in reaction to an event. For instance, a rough heuristic for when to start doing surveys is one week after an event. Similarly, there is also a suggested time point which marks a decrease in relevance, suggested at 3 weeks after the event as a guideline. Those oddly specific time points can be seen as specifying propagation dynamics of memes, perhaps being spawned in a memetic ecosystem and then being assimilated or rendered extinct.
